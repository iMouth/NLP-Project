They packed a selection of sandwiches, an array of salads, and a diverse range of fruits to share among themselves, ensuring that everyone could enjoy the pleasant outdoor dining experience. \n\nContext: \n\n example, an average ratio of CO/NO x of 137 ppm ppm À1 was found for old-type residential boilers fired with dry wood logs (Johansson et al., 2004) . Another wood combustion study by Koyuncu and Pinar (2007) yielded a CO/NO x ratio of 195 ppm ppm À1 for a domestic heating stove operated with firewood. Although particulate matter was mostly dominated by wood combustion emission, we did not observe CO/NO x ratios 4100 ppm ppm À1 in winter because the traffic emissions strongly decreased the ratio due to their relatively high gaseous emissions. According to Johansson et al. (2004) and Kirchstetter et al. (1999) , the PM/CO (PM/NO x ) emission ratio of old-type wood boilers are between 3 and 20 (35-2400) times higher than for mixed traffic conditions. Only a small percentage of traffic PM emissions is thus needed to substantially reduce the CO/NO x ratio from pure wood burning conditions closer to the traffic emission ratios. For example, 90% PM from wood burning and 10% PM from traffic (see discussion of 14 C results below) would lead to a CO/NO x ratio in the range of 13-31, which is similar to the CO/NO x value of 16.776.5 ppm ppm À1 observed in the evening periods in Roveredo\n\nQuestion: \n\nWhat emissions are produced by burning wood?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

They packed a selection of sandwiches, an array of salads, and a diverse range of fruits to share among themselves, ensuring that everyone could enjoy the pleasant outdoor dining experience. \n\nContext: \n\n The combustion of wood leads to the emission of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter. The latter consists of a high amount of BC and organic compounds, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or humic-like substances (HULIS) (Hoffer et al., 2006; Kochbach et al., 2006) . Wood combustion performed at poor operating conditions, e.g., low temperatures such as in old stoves, leads to higher emissions of CO and particulate matter compared to combustion in automatic or certified furnaces (Johansson et al., 2004) . The combustion of fossil fuel in motor vehicles occurs at high temperatures, which generally leads to high NO x emissions, and thus distinctly lower CO/NO x emission ratios in comparison to wood burning. \n\n As mentioned above, wood combustion emits much more CO and less NO x than traffic, due to non-ideal combustion and lower combustion temperature, respectively (e.g., Kirchstetter et al., 1999; Johansson et al., 2004; Koyuncu and Pinar, 2007) . Therefore, the ratio of CO/NO x might be used as an indicator for the relative emission strength of wood burning and traffic. Fig. 7 shows that a positive correlation (r 2 ¼ 0.5) between a 370-520 nm and the ratio of CO/NO x is found for conditions influenced by fresh\n\nQuestion: \n\nDoes burning wood produce more NO than burning fossil fuels?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

For example, sulfate aerosols scatter sunlight and therefore have a cooling effect, while black carbon (BC) aerosols absorb sunlight resulting in a warming effect (Andreae, 2001) . Furthermore, aerosols have an indirect effect by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) which leads to a distribution of the cloud's liquid water over more and smaller droplets. As a result, the optical properties and lifetime of clouds in the atmosphere change. Both the direct and indirect effects of the anthropogenic aerosols together produce a cooling effect on the radiative balance (IPCC, 2007) . \n\n The a 370-950 nm values observed in Roveredo for the winter period were often closer to the literature values of 2 obtained from biomass smoke particles (Kirchstetter et al., 2004; Schmid et al. 2006) , than to the literature values of $1.0-1.1 from diesel soot or traffic studies (Schnaiter et al., 2003 (Schnaiter et al., , 2005;; Kirchstetter et al., 2004) .

Especially the fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter o2.5 mm (PM 2.5 ) is of great concern because it can easily enter the human respiratory system. Many studies have provided evidence that ambient PM 2.5 concentration strongly correlates with mortality rate (e.g., Dockery et al., 1993; Laden et al., 2006) , and that long-term exposure of combustion-related fine particulates increases the risk for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality (Pope et al., 2002) . \n\n example, an average ratio of CO/NO x of 137 ppm ppm À1 was found for old-type residential boilers fired with dry wood logs (Johansson et al., 2004) .

Wood combustion performed at poor operating conditions, e.g., low temperatures such as in old stoves, leads to higher emissions of CO and particulate matter compared to combustion in automatic or certified furnaces (Johansson et al., 2004) . The combustion of fossil fuel in motor vehicles occurs at high temperatures, which generally leads to high NO x emissions, and thus distinctly lower CO/NO x emission ratios in comparison to wood burning. \n\n example, an average ratio of CO/NO x of 137 ppm ppm À1 was found for old-type residential boilers fired with dry wood logs (Johansson et al., 2004) . Another wood combustion study by Koyuncu and Pinar (2007) yielded a CO/NO x ratio of 195 ppm ppm À1 for a domestic heating stove operated with firewood. Although particulate matter was mostly dominated by wood combustion emission, we did not observe CO/NO x ratios 4100 ppm ppm À1 in winter because the traffic emissions strongly decreased the ratio due to\n\nQuestion: \n\nCan you explain how humic-like substances (HULIS) in particulate matter from wood combustion can impact human health?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

Most plants that are tolerant to heavy metal stress, intensify their symbiosis (higher root colonisation) with AM at the stage of high-nutrient demand, e.g., at the reproductive stage. The AM symbiosis of Thlaspi praecox results in enhanced phosphate (P) uptake and decreased zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) uptake compared with non-mycorrhizal treatments, indicating the great importance of even low levels of symbiosis under heavy metal stress (Hildebrandt et al. 2007 ). The alleviating potential of AM on heavy metal stress is determined by different factors: type and concentration of heavy metal, plant specification and growth conditions (Hildebrandt et al. 1999; Turnau & Mesjasz-Przybylowicz 2003) . Molecular analyses have indicated mechanisms involved in heavy metal tolerance of AM. \n\n Under arid and semi-arid conditions, drought or water deficiency states constitute one of the most common stresses affecting plant growth and yield (Kramer & Boyer 1997; Feng et al. 2002) . Similar to salinity stress, drought also affects plant growth through affecting osmotic potential (Ruiz-Lozano 2003) . To alleviate osmotic stress, plants respond using anatomical, physiological and cellular mechanisms (Bray 1997) .

In this obligate association, fungal spores perceive the presence of the host plant through biochemical communication between the two partners and, after approaching the plant roots, AM produce fungal hyphae that grow into the apoplastic space of the host root cortical cells. Highly branched tissues (arbuscules), which are the exchange interface for nutrients and carbon between AM and the host plant, and storage tissues (vesicles) are then formed. It is known that AM fungi can enhance plant growth and production under different conditions, including various soil stresses (Rillig 2004; Hildebrandt et al. 2007; Miransari et al. 2007 Miransari et al. , 2008 Miransari et al. , 2009a,b;,b; Daei et al. 2009) . \n\n AM symbiosis with plants has been observed in soils containing heavy metals (Chaudhry et al. 1999; Khan et al. 2000) .

Although increased salinity reduces AM colonisation of plant roots, the dependency of plants on AM symbiosis is increased, indicating the significance of AM to alleviate salinity stress on plant growth (Tian et al. 2004) .

Resistant and non-resistant AM species utilise different mechanisms to enhance plant growth and production under salinity stress. Mechanisms of salt tolerance in non-resistant AM species include improvement of nutrient (N and P) uptake by host plants, while resistant AM species cause enhanced leaf respiration and transpiration, which increases the exchange of carbon dioxide and water through stomatal activity and eventually affects water use efficiency of host plants. AM salt-tolerant species can also alleviate salinity stress on plant growth through increasing the concentration of osmolytes, such as carbohydrates and electrolytes in plant roots (Ruiz-Lozano et al. 1996;\n\nQuestion: \n\nWhat are some mechanisms of salt tolerance in non-resistant AM species?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

Resistant and non-resistant AM species utilise different mechanisms to enhance plant growth and production under salinity stress. Mechanisms of salt tolerance in non-resistant AM species include improvement of nutrient (N and P) uptake by host plants, while resistant AM species cause enhanced leaf respiration and transpiration, which increases the exchange of carbon dioxide and water through stomatal activity and eventually affects water use efficiency of host plants. AM salt-tolerant species can also alleviate salinity stress on plant growth through increasing the concentration of osmolytes, such as carbohydrates and electrolytes in plant roots (Ruiz-Lozano et al. 1996;\n\nQuestion: \n\nWhat are some adverse effects of salinity on AM symbiosis?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

Similar to salinity stress, drought also affects plant growth through affecting osmotic potential (Ruiz-Lozano 2003) . To alleviate osmotic stress, plants respond using anatomical, physiological and cellular mechanisms (Bray 1997) . Mycorrhizal plants are able to grow much better under such conditions compared with non-mycorrhizal plants (Auge 2001; Subramanian et al. 2006) . Drought tolerance of plants, including corn (Sylvia et al. 1993; Subramanian et al. 1995) , soybean (Bethlenfalvay et al. 1988) wheat, onion, lettuce (Subramanian et al. 2006 ) and other species of agricultural interest (Auge 2001) , increases in symbioses with AM. \n\n The adverse effects of salinity on AM symbiosis are caused by inhibition of spore germination (Hirrel 1981; Juniper & Abbott 2006 ) and hyphal growth and development (McMillen et al. 1998) , as well as reduced production of arbuscules (Pfeiffer & Bloss 1988) .

Adjustment of osmotic potential by AM is probably one of the most important reasons for the improved ability of the host plant to grow under water stress. Through the higher accumulation of organic products, e.g., proline, glycine betaine, carbohydrates such as sucrose and mannitol and non-organic ions including K and Cl, mycorrhizal plants can enhance biomass production under stress relative to nonmycorrhizal plants (Azco ´n et al. 1996; Goicoechea et al. 1998; Ruiz-Lozano 2003; Ruiz-Lozano et al. 2006) . It is also noteworthy that AM can influence plant growth under water stress through affecting soil structure. AM hyphae can enhance soil structure by binding soil particles and through production of glomalin, which affect soil moisture retention (Auge 2001; Ruiz-Lozano 2003; Auge et al. 2004; Rillig 2004) . \n\n AM symbiosis with plants has been observed in soils containing heavy metals (Chaudhry et al. 1999; Khan et al. 2000) . Most plants that are tolerant to heavy metal stress, intensify their symbiosis (higher root colonisation) with AM at the stage of high-nutrient demand, e.g., at the reproductive stage.

AM can significantly increase plant growth and production under stress due to the formation of extensive hyphal networks and production of biochemicals like glomalin. Such abilities can result in enhanced water and nutrient uptake and improved soil structure. However, it should be mentioned that high levels of stress may turn the symbiosis between the two partners into a parasitic relationship, as unfavourable conditions may adversely influence AM performance (Rillig 2004; Hildebrandt et al. 2007; Miransari et al. 2007 Miransari et al. , 2008 Miransari et al. , 2009a,b),b) . The adverse effects of AM on plant growth under stress conditions can be through unfavourable effects of the stress on AM functioning and development. These effects include decreased colonisation rate and spore germination, as well as decreased fungal hyphal growth (Jahromi et al. 2008; Evelin et al. 2009 ).

Metabolic presbycusis was characterized clinically as showing a flat audiometric pattern [20] . An alteration of endolymph may explain the elevated pure tone thresholds across all frequencies of the auditory spectrum. Accompanying or directly resulting age-related changes in the stria vascularis are loss of expression of key ion transport enzymes, such as Na + , K + -ATPase and the Na + , K + , Cl − co-transporter, as well as a dramatic age-related decrease in endocochlear potential (EP) values. The EP is an 80-100 mV dc resting potential in the scala media (Figure 1 ). Additionally, an increased threshold of the compound action potential (CAP) of the auditory nerves may be an indication of loss of auditory nerve function. The reduced amplitudes of action potentials have been interpreted as a possible decline in synchronized neural activity in the auditory nerve. However, it remains difficult to distinguish dysfunctions of the auditory nerve caused by a decreased EP from those\n\nQuestion: \n\nWhat is presbycusis, and what is its most common cause?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

The apical surface of the hair cell has a relatively high inertial resistance to movement, so that sound-induced shearing forces bend the stereocilia. This bending produces mechanical opening of ionic channels [16] , depolarizing hair cells due to K + influx. Conversely, stereocilia bending in the opposite direction create a hyperpolarization by closing those channels that are constantly open, even in the resting state, thus further obstructing K + flow down the electrochemical gradient. Within the cochlea, hair cell sensitivity to frequencies progresses in a tonotopic pattern from high frequencies at the base to low frequencies at the apex. The cells in the single row of inner hair cells passively respond to deflections of sound-induced pressure waves. Cells in the rows of outer hair cells can elongate or shorten in response to motion of the basilar membrane to actively produce amplification or attenuation of the response of the inner hair cells [17] . Efferent innervation by fibres from the olivary nucleus caudally and the dorsal nucleus of the trapezoid body rostrally also provide regulation of the sensitivity of the inner and\n\nQuestion: \n\nHow do cells in the rows of outer hair cells actively produce amplification or attenuation of the response of the inner hair cells?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

However, the rate of hearing decline is not linear and is highly variable, and the variance in hearing level is only weakly associated with age [11] . These observations suggest that age-related changes do not occur uniformly and that more than one pathological process may be acting upon the auditory system. This variety may also be taken as indirect evidence of the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of presbycusis. Adding to the complexity, both the peripheral and central auditory pathways can be affected in presbycusis. \n\n Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss (ARHL), is polygenic/multifactorial in aetiology [1] . ARHL is thought to result from age-related degeneration of the cochlea with the cumulative effects of extrinsic damage (noise and other ototoxic agents) and intrinsic disorders (e.g. systemic diseases). The gradual presbycusic loss of hearing sensitivity is associated with difficulty in speech discrimination. Presbycusis sufferers first have a high tone hearing loss (HL), which has a major adverse effect on communication, particularly in noisy and/or reverberant listening situations. Once the loss progresses to the 2-4 kHz range, thresholds for word, consonant and even vowel identification are increased [2] .\n\nQuestion: \n\nAre the age-related changes in hearing uniform, and what does this suggest about the pathology of presbycusis?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

Metabolic presbycusis was characterized clinically as showing a flat audiometric pattern [20] . An alteration of endolymph may explain the elevated pure tone thresholds across all frequencies of the auditory spectrum. Accompanying or directly resulting age-related changes in the stria vascularis are loss of expression of key ion transport enzymes, such as Na + , K + -ATPase and the Na + , K + , Cl − co-transporter, as well as a dramatic age-related decrease in endocochlear potential (EP) values. The EP is an 80-100 mV dc resting potential in the scala media (Figure 1 ). Additionally, an increased threshold of the compound action potential (CAP) of the auditory nerves may be an indication of loss of auditory nerve function. The reduced amplitudes of action potentials have been interpreted as a possible decline in synchronized neural activity in the auditory nerve. However, it remains difficult to distinguish dysfunctions of the auditory nerve caused by a decreased EP from those\n\nQuestion: \n\nWhat are some of the genetic factors that contribute to presbycusis in mice, and how do they relate to human presbycusis?\n\nAnswer: \n\n"

Using the same analytical method, the National Academy of Science-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) ageing twin panel study in the USA has estimated the heritability at 61% [37] . Across all ages, environmental and hereditary factors were found to be important sources of variation, with environmental factors becoming more influential with increasing age. In the Framingham cohort, heritability of presbycusis phenotypes was estimated to be 0.35-0.55, based on evaluations of audiometric examinations in the Framingham cohort [35] . The study compared the auditory status in genetically unrelated (spouse pairs) and 192 XZ Liu et al genetically related people (sibling pairs, parent-child pairs), revealing a clear familial aggregation for agerelated hearing levels. The effect of genes was found larger for the strial pattern of HL (flat audiogram) compared to the sensory phenotype (abrupt high-tone loss). Heritability index was high in pairings of women (sister-sister, 0.53; mother-daughter, 0.36).

Concomitant with the increase in ROS is a reduced production or function of the endogenous enzymes that protect the cell from ROS damage. The loss of antioxidant defence appears to be involved in the ageing process. Two classes of antioxidant enzymes are active in the cochlea: enzymes involved in glutathione (GSH) metabolism (glutathione S-transferase, GST; glutathione peroxidase, GPX1; glutathione reductase, GSR) and enzymes involved in the breakdown of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide (eg catalase, CAT; Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, SOD1) [49, 50] . Impaired function of antioxidant enzymes caused by genetic variation has been postulated as leading to failure of cellular responses against the toxic effects of ROS and subsequent peroxidative cell injury.
