Q: What are the clinical characteristics of monkeypox?
A: The clinical characteristics of monkeypox are quite similar to those of smallpox, but the monkeypox is clinically milder. 37, [251] [252] [253] It is crucial to realize that monkeypox and smallpox differ mainly by the occurrence of lymphadenopathy, 141 since 90% of monkeypox patients suffer from lymph node enlargement. 254 Monkeypox is most commonly confused with chickenpox, caused by varicellazoster virus (VZV). In terms of their clinical characteristics, these two diseases share a great deal in common. Moreover, several studies have reported that individuals are infected both monkeypox virus and VZV. 66, 67, 127 The incubation time of monkeypox virus is usually 5-21 days. 162, 183, 255, 256 According to Miura's report, incubation period (18 cases) is estimated to be 8.5 days on average. 255 Based on 22 possible (N = 1) and confirmed (N = 21) monkeypox patients reported in the United States through 6, 2022, Charniga and colleagues estimated the incubation time for monkeypox. 256 According to their study, the incubation time from exposure to the onset of symptoms was 7.6 days on average. Besides, another research found that among 23 people with known history of exposure, the median incubation period was 7 days (between 3 and 20 days). 179 In humans, monkeypox disease can be divided into two phases: the prodrome and the rash. Initial symptoms of monkeypox virus infection include headache, lack of energy, fever, chills and/or sweats, sore throat, muscle ache, and lymphadenopathy 5, [257] [258] [259] [260] (Fig. 2) . Usually, few days after fever and lymphadenopathy, the rash appears. Rash starts with the face and then appears the whole body, and is characterized by a few to several thousand lesions. 83, 91, 261 As the rash progresses about 2-4 weeks, plaque is replaced by papules, blisters, pustules, scabs, followed by shedding. 28, 254, 262 Complications of monkeypox include encephalitis, keratitis, pneumonitis, and secondary bacterial infections. 28, 143, 254, 263 In the United States, a report on the epidemiological and clinical features of monkeypox cases showed 42% of persons (n = 291 participants) has no prodromal symptoms, and 37% of patients did not have fever as of the time of assessment, despite most patients included typical features. 122 And genital rashes were observed in many cases, which was also recently proven in another studies. [264] [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] [270] Other recent reports describe similar clinical characteristics. 180, 271, 272 Patel and colleagues 272 demonstrated that all 197 monkeypox infection cases developed mucocutaneous lesions, typically in the genitals (111 of 197 patients) or the perianal areas, causing rectal pain and penile edema. Moreover, according to a case report from Spain, 78 of 181 persons had lesions in the oral and perioral region and 141 in the anogenital region. The following complications occurred in 70 of the 181 patients: 45 (24.9%) of 181 had a proctitis, 19 (10.5%) tonsillitis, and 6 (3.3%) had a bacterial skin abscess. 180 The clinician should remain vigilant for monkeypox-like rashes regardless of whether the rash has disseminated or had a prodrome prior to the rash. Notably, the possibility of some monkeypox virus infections being asymptomatic has been raised by two recent case reports from Europe. It has been shown in several studies that monkeypox could go unobserved when it is propagable, so physicians and persons at high risk should be aware of this fact. 171, 172, 273 Available data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States indicated that 28-51% have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among MSM patients with monkeypox. 122, 167, 179, 180, 272, 274 Currently, the risk for monkeypox infection is unknown, however, in people with HIV.
A: Symptoms of monkeypox last 2-4 weeks, and the disease is usually self-limiting. The lethality of monkeypox patients after infection depend on the clade of virus infected, route of infection, patient age, and patients infected with the CA clade of the virus is generally higher than the WA clade. 6, 70, 141, 275 Previous reports 80, 83, 97, [276] [277] [278] indicated that the case fatality rates (CFR) of monkeypox ranging from 1 to 11%. What's more, in a systematic review that exclusively evaluated the case fatality rates (CFR) by clades, the overall rate of case fatalities was confirmed to be 8.7%, MV can also wrap an additional envelope and attached to the cell membrane, then then release through exocytosis. Cidofovir and its prodrug brincidofovir inhibit the viral DNA polymerase during DNA replication. Tecovirimat targets the VP37 protein, which is vital for envelopment of intracellular mature virus with Golgi-derived membrane to form enveloped virus (EV), prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body which was significantly lower for West African clade (3.6%, 95% CI 1.7-6.8%) than Central African clade (10.6%, 8.4-13.3%). 1, 66 Among 1958 patients, some 4% (95% CI 1-9%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes. 260 In the current 2022 monkeypox outbreak, it was reported that patients at least sixteen years old always have milder symptoms in the current investigations, with a pooled case fatality rate of 0.03% (1 of 2941 patients). 279 Monkeypox is more often fatal in children, which is similar to smallpox. 36, 80 As of September 2022, a total of 15 deaths have been documented in this monkeypox global outbreak, in which 9 deaths in locations that have historically recorded monkeypox.

Q: What are the mechanisms of monkeypox virus infection?
A: Monkeypox virus is a species of double-stranded DNA virus which causes monkeypox in humans and other animals. It belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus in the family Poxviridae. Among all animal viruses, poxviruses have the largest and most complex DNA genomes. 194, 195 There are four major elements of the virion: core, lateral bodies, outer membrane, and the outer lipoprotein envelope. 196 The central core contains the viral dsDNA and core fibrils. The monkeypox virus genome consists of 197 kb with the central genomic region comprising of 101 kb. 17 Both terminal variables regions include a 6379 bp terminal inverted repetition (ITR) with approximately 80 bp long hairpin loop, 70 or 54 bp short tandem repeats and unique ITR sequences NR 1 and NR 2 and the coding region. 32, 197, 198 The virus contains about 190 nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 17, 197, 199, 200 four of which are located in the ITR sequence. 197 Genes responsible for viral replication, transcription, assembly, and release are conservatively located in the genome's central region, as they are in all orthopoxviruses. 200 While most of the genes expressing virulence and host tropism are found at both ends of the genome. These terminal genes play a role in immune evasion by interfering with signaling, presentation, and recognition of antigens and apoptosis. [201] [202] [203] Monkeypox virus has a low frequency of genomic mutations, due to the DNA double-stranded structure, and the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of its DNA polymerase. 204, 205 However, the 2022 monkeypox virus diverges from the related 2018-2019 viruses by a mean of 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), considering previous estimates of the substitution rate for orthopoxviruses, this is much higher than expected. 39, 206 Such a divergent branch could speed up the evolution of the monkeypox virus. Notably, further examination of the mutational profiles of these SNPs suggested a dramatic mutational bias, with 26 (14 nonsynonymous, 10 synonymous, and 2 intergenic) and 15 (nine nonsynonymous and 16 synonymous) being GA>AA and TC>TT nucleotide replacements, respectively. Several studies have indicated that mutations observed in viral genome editing may be caused by apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) enzymes. [207] [208] [209] [210] [211] [212] Another phylogenetic analysis indicated that the monkeypox virus-2022 strains contained 46 new consensus mutations, including 24 nonsynonymous mutations, compared with the monkeypox virus-2018 strain. 213 We suspected that the lower mortality and higher transmission of 2022 monkeypox virus than previous monkeypox virus may related to these viral mutations. Although these viruses are under continual adaptation, it is unknown whether these mutations contribute to help the virus evade host immunity. To further understand how these mutations affect viral function, additional research is required.
A: Unlike other DNA viruses, monkeypox virus replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell. 196 Poxviruses enter into the host cell may be divided into 3 steps ( Fig. 3 ): virus attachment, hemifusion, and core entry, which occurs at the cell membrane or following endocytosis. 196, 214, 215 A unique feature of poxviruses is that they produce two types of infectious particles: extracellular virions (EVs) and mature virions (MVs), both viral particles have different viral surface epitopes. 216 Poxviruses enter cells through different mechanisms depending on their infectious forms, mature virion (MV) with single outer membrane, or enveloped virion (EV) with additional membrane and different protein composition. [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] [222] Despite not being able to identify specific receptors for poxviruses, many glycosaminoglycans including heparin sulfates and chondroitin, as well as laminin, contribute to their attachment to cells. 217, 223, 224 Up to now, many researches have been demonstrated that several vaccinia virus proteins are vital for binding to the cell surface, including D8L, 225, 226 A27L, 227, 228 A34R, 229-232 A26L 224 and H3L. [233] [234] [235] It is following viral attachment that the virion binds to the membrane and fuses with the host cell, causing its core to be released into the cell's cytoplasm. Virion core contains enzymes and factors that initiate transcription. It was proven that L1, F9, A28, A27, L5, H2 were essential viral envelope proteins for cellular entry. [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] Virus-encoded multisubunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase initiates viral transcription, which is followed by host ribosome-mediated translation of early, intermediate, and late proteins. The intermediate and late stages of viral gene transcription require cooperation with hostderived transcription factors. [244] [245] [246] [247] [248] Synthesis of poxvirus DNA occurs in the cytoplasm. A majority of viral particles remain in the cytoplasm as intracellular mature virions (IMVs) and are encased within the protein matrix of scabs. A second envelope (intracellular enveloped virions, IEVs) may be acquired by the remaining virions, and they are attached to the cell membrane of their host. 249 As cell surface-associated enveloped virions (CEVs), they cause cell-to-cell transmission of the virus, while extracellular enveloped virions (EEVs) contribute to systemic transmission. 250 

Q: What is the monkeypox virus?
A: Monkeypox, an endemic disease in both West and Central Africa, before 2022 outbreak, a few cases were reported outside of Africa and these were associated with imports from endemic countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] However, following the initial case diagnosed in the United Kingdom, the number of monkeypox infection have dramatically increased. 3, 4, [6] [7] [8] We are now facing the first multiple countries outbreak most with no clear epidemiological links to the endemic countries. 9, 10 World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General has announced the ongoing monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 11, 12 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that as of 13 September 2022 more than 57,995 confirmed cases had been documented in 100 countries/territories 13 (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ).
A: Monkeypox virus belongs to the Poxviridae family's Orthopoxvirus (OPV) genus, along with variola virus (VARV, also known as smallpox), vaccinia virus (VACV), camelpox virus (CMPV), and cowpox virus (CPXV), [14] [15] [16] all of which are pathogenic for humans. There was 96.3% identity between the monkeypox virus genome's central region, which encodes essential enzymes and structural proteins, and VARVs, which means they are highly genetically similar. 17, 18 In 1980, the WHO certified that smallpox had been eradicated worldwide after successful vaccination. [19] [20] [21] [22] Monkeypox virus has double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as its genetic material that resembles brick-like particles ranging in size from 200-250 nm in diameter and thus can be seen by electron microscopy (magnified approximately ×10,000). 23, 24 In monkeypox virus, there are two genetic clades: West Africa (WA, Clade II) clade and Congo Basin (CB, Clade I) clade, 25, 26 the latter is also known as the Central African (CA) clade and more severe after infection. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] In 1958, monkeypox virus was first discovered in Copenhagen among laboratory monkeys, and its first monkeypox virus infection of a human occurred in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in a 9-month-old child, with suspected smallpox. [33] [34] [35] Monkeypox is endemic in both West Africa and Central Africa since 1970, with a mortality rate between 1 and 10%. 36, 37 Sequencing analysis of the current outbreak of monkeypox indicates that the virus is Western African in origin. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] Recently, the number of patients of monkeypox has increased dramatically, provoking great concern. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] For this epidemic to be controlled, monkeypox virus must be better understood and re-evaluated. 50, 51 Here, we review the recent investigations on monkeypox, including epidemiology of monkeypox, monkeypox virus reservoirs, novel transmission patterns, mutations and mechanisms of viral infection, clinical characteristics, laboratory diagnosis and treatment measures, as well as prevention of monkeypox infection.
A: Cameroon, one of which has been confirmed. 61, 62 In 1996, the DRC experienced a prolonged outbreak of human monkeypox. Initially, a patient was confirmed in February 1996, and until August of that year, a total of 71 suspected monkeypox cases were reported. As of 1999, over 500 patients of monkeypox were reported in the DRC. 61, [63] [64] [65] From February to August 2001, a total of 16 cases of monkeypox were identified in the province of Equateur in the DRC. 66 Meanwhile, a study conducted by Anne et al. 67 in the DRC from 2001 to 2004 examined vesicle fluids and crusted scabs from 136 people suspected of having monkeypox. They found 51 patients of monkeypox.
A: Human monkeypox attracted little attention worldwide until the first outbreak outside Africa occurred in the United States in 2003. 68, 69 Forty-seven cases, with confirmed (37 patients) and suspected (10 patients) monkeypox were reported, and all people infected by contact with pet prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.). 70 The pets were infected after being in close proximity to imported small mammals (African rodents, rope squirrels (Funiscuirus spp.), tree squirrels (Heliosciurus spp.), Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys spp.), brushtail porcupines (Atherurus spp.), dormice (Graphiurus spp.), and striped mice (Hybomys spp.) from Ghana. According to CDC, laboratory tests using virus isolation and PCR amplification have proved that at least three dormice, two rope squirrels, and one Gambian giant rat were found to be infected by monkeypox. It was noted that no deaths occurred and no human-to-human transmission was observed, 68 which was explained by the strain being a West African strain, based on genetic analysis. 69 In addition, a study has conducted to evaluate the effects of the route of infection on the clinical illness of human monkeypox and demonstrated that significant symptoms of systemic diseases were more likely to occur in cases exposed to complex exposures than in cases exposed to noninvasive exposures (49.1 vs. 16.7%; P = 0.041). 70 In contrast to Africa, a large number of cases confirmed in this outbreak are adults. 71 In 2003, the Republic of Congo (ROC) reported the first outbreak of human monkeypox. It was recorded in this outbreak that 11 patients of monkeypox were confirmed and probable, all of whom were younger than 18 years of age, one death occurred. It is believed that the monkeypox virus has been transmitted from human to human six consecutive times, making it the longest recorded series of consecutive transmissions of monkeypox from one individual to another. 72 In Unity State, Sudan, between September and December 2005, ten confirmed and nine possible patients of monkeypox were described in 5 villages (2 in Bentiu, 3 in Modin, 5 in Nuria, 5 in Rubkona, and 4 in Wang Kay). 73 Between 2010 and 2018, varying numbers of monkeypox patients were documented in several African countries, including DRC, 74, 75 CAR, [76] [77] [78] Cameroon, 79, 80 Liberia, 76 Sierra Leone, 81 as well as COA. 82 In addition, it was reported in 2017 that Nigeria was experiencing an outbreak. 122 confirmed or possible patients of human monkeypox were reported between September 2017 and September 2018 in 17 states in Nigeria. Six deaths were recorded (case fatality rate 6%). [83] [84] [85] Thousands of people around the world have been infected by the monkeypox outbreak in 2022, which followed several years of sporadic cases outside of Africa (United Kingdom, [86] [87] [88] Singapore, 89, 90 Israel, 91, 92 United States 93 ). On May 2022, multiple cases of monkeypox were identified in the United Kingdom. 2 On 6 May 2022, an individual with travel ties to Nigeria was diagnosed with monkeypox. 94 On 12 May, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) in London confirmed two additional cases of monkeypox. 95 There is no link between the two of them and they have never traveled to the endemic region. A week later, another four cases were confirmed. Unusually, there was no known contact between these patients and the previous confirmed cases. 96 By polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiment of patient swab samples, the outbreak was caused by the West African clade of monkeypox virus, which is less fatal than the other known monkeypox variant (CB, Clade I) after infection, with a case lethally rate of only 1%. 39, 50, 97, 98 Portugal, Canada, and Spain documented 14, 13, and 7 cases of monkeypox, respectively, on 18 May. [99] [100] [101] It was also the same day that the United States identified its first monkeypox patient of 2022. 102 On 19 May, Belgium and Sweden reported their first cases. 103, 104 Belgium announced that monkeypox cases were required to be isolated for 21 days at once. Belgium also became the first country in the world to require self-isolation of monkeypox cases. At the same time, Italy has reported first case, a traveler from the Canary Islands. 105 Besides, France has reported a suspected case. Genomic analysis the virus isolated from a monkeypox virus infecting case in Portugal showed that the virus also belonged to the WA branch of evolution, closest to the virus carried by cases imported from Nigeria in 2018 and 2019. 43 Two Fig. 1 Geographical distribution of confirmed monkeypox cases during the outbreak between January and September 2022. Confirmed cases include those laboratory-confirmed as monkeypox virus and may include cases only confirmed as orthopoxvirus. Data presented as of 12 September 2022 were obtained from CDC. Diagram generated with GraphPad Prism 9 patients of monkeypox were confirmed in Australia on 20 May, both of whom had recently returned from travel to Europe. 106 On the same day, the first cases were confirmed in Germany, as well as in the Netherlands and France. [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] On the next day, the first cases were confirmed in both Switzerland 111 and Israel, 112 and the patient documented by the Israeli Ministry of Health is also the first case of monkeypox in Asia. 113 After May 2022, a large number of monkeypox patients were confirmed in non-endemic countries worldwide. This unusual outbreak promoting the WHO to declare monkeypox as an \"evolving threat of moderate public health concern\" on June 23. Furthermore, the WHO announced that monkeypox outbreaks in many countries and regions constitute a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" (PHEIC) on July 23, 2022. 114, 115 Meanwhile, monkeypox prevention and treatment guidelines have been issued in several countries around the world. 116 As of 13 September 2022, 57,995 monkeypox virus infections which were laboratory confirmed have been reported in >100 countries or regions across all six WHO regions 13 (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Of these, a total of 18 deaths were reported in 9 countries. In particular, a very recent news indicated that the first person of monkeypox was confirmed in Hong Kong on September 6. 117 Epidemiological investigation revealed that this patient arrived in Hong Kong from the Philippines on September 5 at the age of 30 years. Consequently, as a result of the monkeypox emergence in Hong Kong, a preparedness and response plan has been activated by the Hong Kong Government. Also, this is the first reported person of monkeypox since the four cases were confirmed in Taiwan Province of China. 118, 119 Notably, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared monkeypox a public health emergency on August 4, 2022 in the United States. 120 The monkeypox epidemic in the United States is extremely serious, as of September 6, monkeypox had since spread to every state, with a total of 20,733 cases. 121, 122 MONKEYPOX VIRUS RESERVOIRS Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease whose natural reservoir remains unknown. 123, 124 Several researches have conducted to determine the reservoir or natural hosts of monkeypox virus, Khodakevich et al. 125, 126 Have reported that antibodies to the virus were found in 2 of 18 squirrels tested. The monkeypox virus was extracted from a diseased squirrel, Funisciurus anerythrus, which was the first report of monkeypox virus being isolated from a wild animal. Other researches have also suggested that squirrels of the genera Funisciurus and Heliosciurus are related to the natural cycle of monkeypox virus in DRC, [127] [128] [129] [130] as well as Rodents of the genera Cricetomys, Graphiurus, elephant shrews of the genus Petrodromus. 127 In March 2012, monkeypox virus was separated from a wild-living monkey (a sooty mangabey) by Radonic et al. 131 Its whole-genome sequence showed that it had significant similarities with monkeypox viruses located in Western Africa. Patrono and colleagues 132 described the frequent appearance of monkeypox virus in a wild-living chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus, hereafter chimpanzee) population from Taï National Park, Ivory Coast. A number of animal species, mostly rodents and nonhuman primates, have been confirmed to be susceptible to the virus after multiple investigations, 133, 134 as listed in Table 2 .
