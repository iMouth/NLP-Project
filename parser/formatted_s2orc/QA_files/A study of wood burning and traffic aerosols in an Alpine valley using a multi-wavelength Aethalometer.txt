Q: What emissions are produced by burning wood?
A: The combustion of wood leads to the emission of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter. The latter consists of a high amount of BC and organic compounds, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or humic-like substances (HULIS) (Hoffer et al., 2006; Kochbach et al., 2006) . Wood combustion performed at poor operating conditions, e.g., low temperatures such as in old stoves, leads to higher emissions of CO and particulate matter compared to combustion in automatic or certified furnaces (Johansson et al., 2004) . The combustion of fossil fuel in motor vehicles occurs at high temperatures, which generally leads to high NO x emissions, and thus distinctly lower CO/NO x emission ratios in comparison to wood burning.
A: The comparison of the diurnal cycles of CO, NO x and b abs (370 nm) and b abs (880 nm) ( Fig. 2 vii, viii, ix and x) showed the following features: the diurnal trends of CO and b abs (370 nm) were very similar, while the diurnal cycle of NO x resembled that of b abs (880 nm). The diurnal cycles of NO x and b abs (880 nm) in winter exhibited two peaks at 10:00 and 20:00 h CET. In contrast, CO and b abs (370 nm) did not peak in the morning but had only a maximum at 20:00 h CET. As will be discussed later, this is due to a higher contribution of wood burning versus traffic in the evening compared to the morning hours. During the night between 20:00 and 5:00 h CET, the decrease of CO, NO x and b abs values can be explained with the reduction of local emissions from traffic and wood burning, and the dilution and advection of cleaner air due to down slope and down valley winds (Pre´voˆt et al., 2000a) . In summer, much lower values and weaker diurnal cycles were observed for CO, NO x , b abs (370 nm) and b abs (880 nm) than those observed in winter. All four parameters exhibited concentration peaks around 06:00 h CET indicating the influence of the morning rush hour traffic emissions and low mixing height. The concentrations then decreased towards midday following the increase in solar radiation which enhanced vertical mixing and photochemistry. During the day mixing often occurs up to 1500-2000 m a.s.l. in summer (Henne et al., 2004) . Some air and pollution within the valley is even transported out of the valley to altitudes of 2000-4000 m a.s.l. (Pre´voˆt et al., 2000b) . In the evening hours between 18:00 and 20:00 h CET, the NO x concentrations increased slightly due to the evening rush hour traffic emissions and again lower mixing height. The lowest values of these four parameters were observed between midnight and 04:00 h CET, when the emissions were low.
A: As mentioned above, wood combustion emits much more CO and less NO x than traffic, due to non-ideal combustion and lower combustion temperature, respectively (e.g., Kirchstetter et al., 1999; Johansson et al., 2004; Koyuncu and Pinar, 2007) . Therefore, the ratio of CO/NO x might be used as an indicator for the relative emission strength of wood burning and traffic. Fig. 7 shows that a positive correlation (r 2 ¼ 0.5) between a 370-520 nm and the ratio of CO/NO x is found for conditions influenced by fresh traffic emission (NO x 420 ppb). A similar positive correlation was observed when plotting a 370-950 nm instead of a 370-520 nm (not shown). The gray symbols in Fig. 7 refer to periods with low NO x values which resulted in higher CO/NO x ratios. In winter, low NO x concentrations were found during the night between 22:00 and 06:00 h CET due to lower emission rates and dilution with aged air having a higher CO/NO x concentration ratio because of the lower lifetime of NO x compared to CO. In summer, photochemical reactions reduced the NO x concentrations more rapidly than carbon monoxide, yielding rather high CO/NO x values during most of the day except the morning hours. In summer (red squares), we obtained a 370-520 nm values of 1.070.1 (same values for a 370-950 nm ) and a CO/NO x of 8.772.0. This ratio is comparable to the CO/NO x values between 8.8 and 9.4 ppm ppm À1 reported by Kirchstetter et al. (1999) for the Caldecott tunnel with 4% heavy-duty diesel traffic in summer 1997. Janha¨ll et al. (2006) found a CO/ NO x ratio of 5.072.6 ppm ppm À1 in an urban aerosol study during winter time in Sweden.
A: In winter between 12:30 and 05:30 h CET (blue diamonds), a 370-520 nm was found to be 2.370.4 (with a 370-950 nm ¼ 1.670.2) and the CO/NO x ratio was 16.776.5 ppm ppm À1 . During the day between 06:00 and 12:00 h CET (green triangles) a 370-520 nm was 1.870.3 (a 370-950 nm ¼ 1.470.2) and the CO/ NO x ratio was 10.974.4 ppm ppm À1 . These CO/ NO x values observed in winter are much lower than those reported in wood combustion studies. For example, an average ratio of CO/NO x of 137 ppm ppm À1 was found for old-type residential boilers fired with dry wood logs (Johansson et al., 2004) . Another wood combustion study by Koyuncu and Pinar (2007) yielded a CO/NO x ratio of 195 ppm ppm À1 for a domestic heating stove operated with firewood. Although particulate matter was mostly dominated by wood combustion emission, we did not observe CO/NO x ratios 4100 ppm ppm À1 in winter because the traffic emissions strongly decreased the ratio due to their relatively high gaseous emissions. According to Johansson et al. (2004) and Kirchstetter et al. (1999) , the PM/CO (PM/NO x ) emission ratio of old-type wood boilers are between 3 and 20 (35-2400) times higher than for mixed traffic conditions. Only a small percentage of traffic PM emissions is thus needed to substantially reduce the CO/NO x ratio from pure wood burning conditions closer to the traffic emission ratios. For example, 90% PM from wood burning and 10% PM from traffic (see discussion of 14 C results below) would lead to a CO/NO x ratio in the range of 13-31, which is similar to the CO/NO x value of 16.776.5 ppm ppm À1 observed in the evening periods in Roveredo (Fig. 7) .

Q: What do aerosols do to the atmosphere?
A: Atmospheric aerosols influence the earth's radiative balance by scattering and/or absorbing sunlight (direct effect). For example, sulfate aerosols scatter sunlight and therefore have a cooling effect, while black carbon (BC) aerosols absorb sunlight resulting in a warming effect (Andreae, 2001) . Furthermore, aerosols have an indirect effect by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) which leads to a distribution of the cloud's liquid water over more and smaller droplets. As a result, the optical properties and lifetime of clouds in the atmosphere change. Both the direct and indirect effects of the anthropogenic aerosols together produce a cooling effect on the radiative balance (IPCC, 2007) .

Especially the fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter o2.5 mm (PM 2.5 ) is of great concern because it can easily enter the human respiratory system. Many studies have provided evidence that ambient PM 2.5 concentration strongly correlates with mortality rate (e.g., Dockery et al., 1993; Laden et al., 2006) , and that long-term exposure of combustion-related fine particulates increases the risk for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality (Pope et al., 2002) .
A: Studies on wood smoke using a dual wavelength Aethalometer (UV-and near-infrared (IR) wavelengths of 370 and 880 nm, respectively) showed that organic compounds in wood smoke aerosols result in a strong UV absorption as measured at the 370-nm wavelength (Jeong et al., 2004; Hand et al., 2005; Park et al., 2006) . The type of wood being burned and the combustion conditions were shown to affect the relative proportion of light absorbed in the UV-and near-IR wavelengths (Day et al., 2006) . In the absence of wood smoke, i.e., at predominantly traffic aerosol-dominated conditions, a lower ratio of the aerosol light absorption at 370 nm compared to that at 880 nm is found (Kirchstetter et al., 2004) .
A: An SMPS and a multi-wavelength Aethalometer were used to study the aerosol size distribution and the aerosol light absorption during winter and summer periods in a village located in an Alpine valley. In winter, approximately 77% of the houses in this village use wood burning for heating. Strong temperature inversion, low wind speed, and low solar radiation throughout the day enhanced the accumulation of aerosol particles in the air during the cold season. Very strong diurnal trends in CO, NO x and aerosol light absorption parameters were observed in winter. The absorption exponents a were between 1.2 and 2.0 (5th-and 95th-percentiles) during the winter campaign. The highest values were comparable to literature studies on wood smoke, i.e., $2. The a values from the summer campaign closely matched the literature values for diesel soot or traffic aerosol, i.e., $1.0-1.1. The GMD of the surface size distribution was 154. Winter NO x > 20ppb, 12:30-05:30 Winter NO x > 20ppb,06:00-12:00
