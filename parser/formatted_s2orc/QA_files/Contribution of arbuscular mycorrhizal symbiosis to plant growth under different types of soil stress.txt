Q: What are the effects of AM on soil with high salinity?
A: Agricultural soils that are salty or subject to salinity limit crop production and account for more than 7% of all agricultural soils worldwide (Jain et al. 1989) . The existence of AM in salt-laden crop soils is very common (Juniper & Abbott 1993) . AM are able to biologically enhance plant growth and crop production in such salty soils (Al-Karaki et al. 2001; Daei et al. 2009) . The different interactions between AM and host plants under different conditions has received much attention for selection of the most efficient isolates, especially when AM and host plants are subjected to different stresses, and also for evaluation of AM functionality and ecology (Johnson et al. 1997; Ruiz-Lozano & Azcó n 2000) . Different species of AM differ in their tolerance to stress. For example, although under stress there are fewer species, those that are more tolerant to the stress can survive and enhance plant ability to grow more efficiently (Tian et al. 2004; Daei et al. 2009) .
A: The adverse effects of salinity on AM symbiosis are caused by inhibition of spore germination (Hirrel 1981; Juniper & Abbott 2006) and hyphal growth and development (McMillen et al. 1998) , as well as reduced production of arbuscules (Pfeiffer & Bloss 1988) . Although increased salinity reduces AM colonisation of plant roots, the dependency of plants on AM symbiosis is increased, indicating the significance of AM to alleviate salinity stress on plant growth (Tian et al. 2004) . When subjected to salinity stress, plants absorb less P (Munns 1993) , but plants can alleviate this stress using different mechanisms (Al-Karaki 2000 , 2006 Al-Karaki et al. 2001; Tian et al. 2004) . Resistant and non-resistant AM species utilise different mechanisms to enhance plant growth and production under salinity stress. Mechanisms of salt tolerance in non-resistant AM species include improvement of nutrient (N and P) uptake by host plants, while resistant AM species cause enhanced leaf respiration and transpiration, which increases the exchange of carbon dioxide and water through stomatal activity and eventually affects water use efficiency of host plants. AM salt-tolerant species can also alleviate salinity stress on plant growth through increasing the concentration of osmolytes, such as carbohydrates and electrolytes in plant roots (Ruiz-Lozano et al. 1996; Feng et al. 2002; Tian et al. 2004; Boomsma & Vyn 2008; Daei et al. 2009) . Other related mechanisms stimulate root development and enhance nutrient uptake via both resistant and non-resistant AM species, respectively (Ruiz-Lozano & Azcó n 2000), as well as enhancing root hydraulic conductivity (Rosendahl & Rosendahl 1991; Giri et al. 2003) .
A: Plant morphological changes when subjected to salinity include decreased root and shoot growth, although under different stresses plant allocate more C to their roots (Hause et al. 1996; Wang et al. 2001; Miransari & Smith 2007 . The adverse effects of sodium (Na) on leaf chlorophyll content have been attributed to the inhibiting effects of Na on magnesium (Mg) absorption. However, since AM are able to increase Mg uptake (Marschner & Dell 1994; Giri et al. 2003; Giri & Mukerji 2004; Miransari et al. 2009a,b) , which is necessary for chlorophyll formation, they can alleviate the adverse effects of Na on photosynthesis in addition to the other beneficial effects of AM on photosynthesis (see above). Adjustment of the K ⁄ Na ratio is another interesting effect of AM on plant growth under salinity conditions as a result of increased K uptake (Giri et al. 2003; Daei et al. 2009) .

Q: What are the effects of AM on soil structure?
A: Another important role of AM is improving soil structure (Ryan & Graham 2002) . Soil properties, root architecture and agricultural practices determine the stability of the soil structure. For example, unsuitable agricultural practices can adversely influence soil structure by decreasing aggregation stability and hence movement of soil particles, particularly clay particles, resulting in reduction of macropores and a partial increase of micropores. These factors are the main reason for increasing soil bulk density (Cardoso & Kuyper 2006; Miransari et al. , 2009a when soil is compacted under heavy traffic, especially at unfavourable levels of fertiliser and moisture. AM fungi affect soil structure through: (i) binding soil particles on extraradical hyphae, (ii) entanglement of microaggregates by hyphae into macroaggregates, and (iii) providing a C source for plants and microorganisms after AM degradation in the soil (Jastrow et al. 1998; Cardoso & Kuyper 2006) . Additionally, production of the glycoprotein, glomalin, by AM hyphae, quantified by measuring soil-related proteins, can greatly contribute to enhancement of soil structure (Rillig 2004) .
A: Glomalin affects soil stability more than AM hyphae alone, because its persistence in the soil is higher (6 to more than 40 years) than AM hyphae (from a few days to a few months) (Rillig et al. 2001) . According to Steinberg & Rillig (2003) , 40-75% of AM hyphae and glomalin can, respectively, be detected in soil 150 day after the onset of symbiosis. High amounts of glomalin are available in the soil, ranging from 12 to 60 mgAEcm )3 in different soils, including forest soils (Rillig et al. 2001) 
A: Between 3% and 5% of total soil C and N in rain forest soils (Cardoso & Kuyper 2006) and 5% and 4% of soil C and N stock, respectively, were found in the form of glomalin (Rillig et al. 2001) . Also, AM hyphae and glomalin account for 15% of soil organic C in grassland (Cardoso & Kuyper 2006) . Because glomalin is hydrophobic, it is able to coat the AM hyphae and related soil particles, resulting in enhanced AM tolerance at gas-water interfaces and reduce disruption of macro-aggregates during wetting and drying cycles in the soil (Rillig 2004) . Moreover, production of glomalin in the soil increases C storage and affects aggregate stability and, hence, soil structure (Cardoso & Kuyper 2006) . Wright et al. (1999) found that the concentration of glomalin was positively correlated with soil structural stability after replacement of conventional tillage with a no-tillage system under corn production. Glomalin production can also affect the soil microbial population as it provides a source of C available to microorganisms (Bai et al. 2009) .
A: Crop rotation can also influence glomalin production and soil structural stability (Wright & Anderson 2000) . Hence, consideration of tillage practices affecting production and protection of hyphae and glomalin can be of great significance for soil structural stability and, thus, reduced soil erosion. AM have been found to increase plant growth under compaction stress through the enhancement of root growth and nutrient uptake (Miransari et al. , 2009a .

Q: What are the effects of AM on plants deficienct in water?
A: Under arid and semi-arid conditions, drought or water deficiency states constitute one of the most common stresses affecting plant growth and yield (Kramer & Boyer 1997; Feng et al. 2002) . Similar to salinity stress, drought also affects plant growth through affecting osmotic potential (Ruiz-Lozano 2003) . To alleviate osmotic stress, plants respond using anatomical, physiological and cellular mechanisms (Bray 1997) . Mycorrhizal plants are able to grow much better under such conditions compared with non-mycorrhizal plants (Auge 2001; Subramanian et al. 2006) . Drought tolerance of plants, including corn (Sylvia et al. 1993; Subramanian et al. 1995) , soybean (Bethlenfalvay et al. 1988) wheat, onion, lettuce (Subramanian et al. 2006) and other species of agricultural interest (Auge 2001) , increases in symbioses with AM.
A: In addition to higher nutrient uptake of mycorrhizal plants under stress, the substantial enhancement of root surface area and dense growth of roots also improve tolerance of mycorrhizal plants under stress (Auge et al. 1994; Subramanian et al. 2006) . Under drought stress, AM affect water movement into the plant, influencing plant hydration and physiological processes (Auge 2001) . Hence, mycorrhizal plants are able to have higher water potential (higher water use efficiency) and can enhance growth at a faster rate when irrigation is restored.
A: Moreover, under water stress, mycorrhizal plants can absorb forms of N that are unavailable to non-mycorrhizal plants, resulting in higher growth under stress (Subramanian et al. 2006) . Adjustment of osmotic potential by AM is probably one of the most important reasons for the improved ability of the host plant to grow under water stress. Through the higher accumulation of organic products, e.g., proline, glycine betaine, carbohydrates such as sucrose and mannitol and non-organic ions including K and Cl, mycorrhizal plants can enhance biomass production under stress relative to nonmycorrhizal plants (Azcó n et al. 1996; Goicoechea et al. 1998; Ruiz-Lozano 2003; Ruiz-Lozano et al. 2006) . It is also noteworthy that AM can influence plant growth under water stress through affecting soil structure. AM hyphae can enhance soil structure by binding soil particles and through production of glomalin, which affect soil moisture retention (Auge 2001; Ruiz-Lozano 2003; Auge et al. 2004; Rillig 2004) .
A: AM symbiosis enhances plant tolerance to drought stress through altering plant physiology and gene expression (Ruiz-Lozano et al. 2006; Aroca et al. 2008; Boomsma & Vyn 2008) . In addition, production of antioxidant enzymes by mycorrhizal plants when subjected to drought stress is another important reason for the enhanced growth of the host plant under such stress (Ruiz-Lozano 2003) .
