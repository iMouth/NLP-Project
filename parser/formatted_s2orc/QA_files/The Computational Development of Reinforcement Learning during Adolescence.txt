Q: Which period of life is characterized by changes in learning and decision-making.
A: Adolescence is a period of life characterised by changes in learning and decision-making. Learning and decision-making do not rely on a unitary system, but instead require the coordination of different cognitive processes that can be mathematically formalised as dissociable computational modules.
A: Adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological changes of puberty and ends with the individual attainment of a stable, independent role in society[1]. During this period, significant changes in value-based decision-making are observed[2]. Adolescents are often characterised as prone to engage in suboptimal decision-making, which although probably adaptive in many circumstances[3â€“6], can sometimes result in negative real life outcomes[7,8].
A: More precisely, we hypothesise that, while the basic RL algorithm successfully encapsulates value-based decision-making in adolescence, adults integrate more sophisticated computations, such as counterfactual learning and value contextualisation. To test this hypothesis, adults and adolescents performed an instrumental probabilistic learning task in which they had to learn which stimuli had the greatest likelihood of resulting in an advantageous outcome through trial and error.
