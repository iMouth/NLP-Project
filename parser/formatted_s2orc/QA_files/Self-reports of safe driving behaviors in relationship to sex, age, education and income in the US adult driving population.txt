Q: What sex is more likely to use seatbelts?
A: The ANOVA on the effects of sex, age, education and income (including all two-way interactions) on the probability of using safety belts all the time revealed significant main effects of sex, age, and education, and a significant interaction of sex with income. Sixty seven percent of the males reported using seatbelts all the time, compared to 78% of the females [F(1,16)= 10.87, P= 0.0046]. The interaction between sex and age was marginally significant (P =0.08). Since sex interacted with two of the other main effects, the results for males and females were analyzed separately. For males, only the main effects of age and education were significant. More old drivers than young reported that they use seat belts all the time [79, 66 and 54% for old, middle-aged and young, respectively, F(2,4)= 11.5, P= 0.022]; More higher-educated males reported using seat belts all the time than lower-educated males [73 vs. 60%, F(1,4)= 10.86, P= 0.03]. An analysis that excluded the non-significant interactions did not change the results. For female drivers, none of the main effects or interactions was found significant, but after removing the interactions from the model, income and education were found significant. Among females, income was directly related to reported use of seatbelts, with highest rates obtained for the highest income females and lowest for the lowest income females [average percentages 88, 81 and 66%, F(2,12)= 8.91, P=0.004]; and more higher-educated females than lower-educated females reported using seatbelts all the time [84 vs. 73%, F(1,12)= 10.86, P= 0.03]. The effects of the three variables on males and females can be appreciated from Figs. 3 and 4 .

Q: What sex is more likely to abstain from drinking and driving?
A: The ANOVA on the effects of sex, age, education and income (including all two-way interactions) on the probability of abstaining from drinking and driving revealed only one significant main effect -sex. No other main effects or interactions were significant. More women than men reported that they abstained from drinking and driving [with average percentages of 91 vs. 76%, F(1,16) =27.67, P=0.0001]. Removing the two-way Fig. 4 . Proportion of female drivers using seat belts all the time by age, education and income.

Q: What sex is more likely to observe speed limits?
A: The ANOVA on the effects of sex, age, education and income (including all two-way interactions) on the probability of observing the speed limits all the time revealed significant main effects of sex, age, education and income, but no significant interactions. The percentage of drivers observing the speed limits all the time was higher for females than for males [with average percentages of 45 vs. 36%, F(1,16)= 23.71, P= 0.0002]; for older drivers than for younger drivers [with average percentages of 52, 42 and 28%, F(2,16)= 51.3, P=0.0001]; for lower-educated than higher-educated drivers [with average percentages of 45 vs. 36%, F(1,16)=22.74, P=0.0002], and for lower-income than higher-income drivers [with average percentages of 48, 41 and 34%, F(2,16)= 18.08, P= 0.0001]. The absence of any interactions indicates that the effects of the four variables are additive and not synergistic. Removal of all the non-significant interactions from the model did not affect the results: all main effects remained significant. The effects of the four variables can be appreciated from Fig. 1 .
