    "abstract": "We present a study of aerosol light absorption using a multi-wavelength Aethalometer (l ¼ 370-950 nm) in an Alpine valley where the major local emissions of aerosols in winter are from domestic wood burning and traffic. The measurements were done in winter and summer periods in 2004 and 2005. Much stronger diurnal trends in CO, NO x and aerosol light absorption parameters were observed in winter than in summer. The average (71 S.D.) PM 10 concentrations measured at this site were 31.5721.7 mg m À3 in winter and 15.8710.0 mg m À3 in summer. The highest PM 10 concentrations were observed between 18:00 and 22:00 h CET in both campaigns, with 45.4721.0 mg m À3 for winter and 21.079.5 mg m À3 for summer. The average (71 S.D.) power law exponents of the absorption coefficients (also called absorption exponent) with l ¼ 370-950 nm, a 370-950 nm were 1.670.25 in winter and 1.170.05 in summer. The calculation of a separately for lower and higher wavelengths (i.e., a 370-520 nm and a 660-950 nm) provided a better description of the wavelength dependence from the UV-to the near-IR region. The highest mean values of a 370-520 nm and a 660-950 nm were observed between 22:00 and 02:00 h CET in winter with 2.770.4 and 1.370.1, respectively. Comparison of a 370-520 nm with CO and NO x data indicated that the relative contribution of wood burning versus traffic was responsible for the seasonal and diurnal variability of a. The seasonal and diurnal trends of a were not attributed to changes in the particle size since the aerosol volume size distributions (dV/d log D) were found to be similar in both campaigns.",

            "question": "What emissions are produced by burning wood?",
            "answers": [
                "The combustion of wood leads to the emission of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter. The latter consists of a high amount of BC and organic compounds, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or humic-like substances (HULIS) (Hoffer et al., 2006; Kochbach et al., 2006) . Wood combustion performed at poor operating conditions, e.g., low temperatures such as in old stoves, leads to higher emissions of CO and particulate matter compared to combustion in automatic or certified furnaces (Johansson et al., 2004) . The combustion of fossil fuel in motor vehicles occurs at high temperatures, which generally leads to high NO x emissions, and thus distinctly lower CO/NO x emission ratios in comparison to wood burning.",
                "The comparison of the diurnal cycles of CO, NO x and b abs (370 nm) and b abs (880 nm) ( Fig. 2 vii, viii, ix and x) showed the following features: the diurnal trends of CO and b abs (370 nm) were very similar, while the diurnal cycle of NO x resembled that of b abs (880 nm). The diurnal cycles of NO x and b abs (880 nm) in winter exhibited two peaks at 10:00 and 20:00 h CET. In contrast, CO and b abs (370 nm) did not peak in the morning but had only a maximum at 20:00 h CET. As will be discussed later, this is due to a higher contribution of wood burning versus traffic in the evening compared to the morning hours. During the night between 20:00 and 5:00 h CET, the decrease of CO, NO x and b abs values can be explained with the reduction of local emissions from traffic and wood burning, and the dilution and advection of cleaner air due to down slope and down valley winds (Pre´voˆt et al., 2000a) . In summer, much lower values and weaker diurnal cycles were observed for CO, NO x , b abs (370 nm) and b abs (880 nm) than those observed in winter. All four parameters exhibited concentration peaks around 06:00 h CET indicating the influence of the morning rush hour traffic emissions and low mixing height. The concentrations then decreased towards midday following the increase in solar radiation which enhanced vertical mixing and photochemistry. During the day mixing often occurs up to 1500-2000 m a.s.l. in summer (Henne et al., 2004) . Some air and pollution within the valley is even transported out of the valley to altitudes of 2000-4000 m a.s.l. (Pre´voˆt et al., 2000b) . In the evening hours between 18:00 and 20:00 h CET, the NO x concentrations increased slightly due to the evening rush hour traffic emissions and again lower mixing height. The lowest values of these four parameters were observed between midnight and 04:00 h CET, when the emissions were low.",
                "As mentioned above, wood combustion emits much more CO and less NO x than traffic, due to non-ideal combustion and lower combustion temperature, respectively (e.g., Kirchstetter et al., 1999; Johansson et al., 2004; Koyuncu and Pinar, 2007) . Therefore, the ratio of CO/NO x might be used as an indicator for the relative emission strength of wood burning and traffic. Fig. 7 shows that a positive correlation (r 2 ¼ 0.5) between a 370-520 nm and the ratio of CO/NO x is found for conditions influenced by fresh traffic emission (NO x 420 ppb). A similar positive correlation was observed when plotting a 370-950 nm instead of a 370-520 nm (not shown). The gray symbols in Fig. 7 refer to periods with low NO x values which resulted in higher CO/NO x ratios. In winter, low NO x concentrations were found during the night between 22:00 and 06:00 h CET due to lower emission rates and dilution with aged air having a higher CO/NO x concentration ratio because of the lower lifetime of NO x compared to CO. In summer, photochemical reactions reduced the NO x concentrations more rapidly than carbon monoxide, yielding rather high CO/NO x values during most of the day except the morning hours. In summer (red squares), we obtained a 370-520 nm values of 1.070.1 (same values for a 370-950 nm ) and a CO/NO x of 8.772.0. This ratio is comparable to the CO/NO x values between 8.8 and 9.4 ppm ppm À1 reported by Kirchstetter et al. (1999) for the Caldecott tunnel with 4% heavy-duty diesel traffic in summer 1997. Janha¨ll et al. (2006) found a CO/ NO x ratio of 5.072.6 ppm ppm À1 in an urban aerosol study during winter time in Sweden.",
                "In winter between 12:30 and 05:30 h CET (blue diamonds), a 370-520 nm was found to be 2.370.4 (with a 370-950 nm ¼ 1.670.2) and the CO/NO x ratio was 16.776.5 ppm ppm À1 . During the day between 06:00 and 12:00 h CET (green triangles) a 370-520 nm was 1.870.3 (a 370-950 nm ¼ 1.470.2) and the CO/ NO x ratio was 10.974.4 ppm ppm À1 . These CO/ NO x values observed in winter are much lower than those reported in wood combustion studies. For example, an average ratio of CO/NO x of 137 ppm ppm À1 was found for old-type residential boilers fired with dry wood logs (Johansson et al., 2004) . Another wood combustion study by Koyuncu and Pinar (2007) yielded a CO/NO x ratio of 195 ppm ppm À1 for a domestic heating stove operated with firewood. Although particulate matter was mostly dominated by wood combustion emission, we did not observe CO/NO x ratios 4100 ppm ppm À1 in winter because the traffic emissions strongly decreased the ratio due to their relatively high gaseous emissions. According to Johansson et al. (2004) and Kirchstetter et al. (1999) , the PM/CO (PM/NO x ) emission ratio of old-type wood boilers are between 3 and 20 (35-2400) times higher than for mixed traffic conditions. Only a small percentage of traffic PM emissions is thus needed to substantially reduce the CO/NO x ratio from pure wood burning conditions closer to the traffic emission ratios. For example, 90% PM from wood burning and 10% PM from traffic (see discussion of 14 C results below) would lead to a CO/NO x ratio in the range of 13-31, which is similar to the CO/NO x value of 16.776.5 ppm ppm À1 observed in the evening periods in Roveredo (Fig. 7) ."

A two-lane highway connecting the San Bernardino Pass and the Gotthard highway passes through the village. A 3-m high concrete wall separates the highway from the measurement container and residential area. In the winter period between December and February, the village lies most of the time in the shadow of the surrounding steep hills and mountains, providing favorable condition for persistent and strong temperature inversions. Approximately 77% of the houses in this village use wood burning for heating in winter, with similar numbers in neighboring villages (H.P. Lo¨tscher, personal communication). The annual mean PM 10 concentration measured in this location has been rather constant at 25 mg m À3 during the last 8 years (ANU Graubu¨nden, www.gr-luft.ch).

For the remaining of this paper, we will refer to this as the absorption exponent a. This empirical power law fit provides a ''standardized'' approach for comparison with data sets from other studies. For example, a values (using the light absorption of all wavelengths l ¼ 370, 470, 520, 590, 660, 880 and 950 nm) up to 1.5 were observed at a high Alpine station during a Saharan dust event (Collaud Coen et al., 2004) . Fialho et al. (2006) calculated a during a Sahara dust event in the Azores archipelago to be 1.070.2 using only the visible wavelengths (l ¼ 470, 520, 590, 660 nm). However, in polluted areas where high soot concentrations are observed-like the village in our study-the absorption of dust is usually negligible. Kirchstetter et al. (2004) reported a values of 2.2 for an outdoor firewood burning, 1.8 for a savanna fire and 0.8-1.1 for traffic-dominated sites (measurements with six wavelengths between 370 and 850 nm). Schnaiter et al. ( , 2005 reported a values of 1.1 for uncoated diesel soot and 2.1 for spark generated (Palas) soot (measurements with l ¼ 450, 550 and 700 nm).

In the calculated particle volume size distributions (dV/d log D) the particles with diameters between 200 and 300 nm contributed most to the aerosol sub-micron mass both in the morning and evening hours. This confirms that traffic and wood combustion result in similar volume size distributions, as also reported by Schneider et al. (2005) and Hedberg et al. (2002) .

The diurnal cycles of NO x and b abs (880 nm) in winter exhibited two peaks at 10:00 and 20:00 h CET. In contrast, CO and b abs (370 nm) did not peak in the morning but had only a maximum at 20:00 h CET. As will be discussed later, this is due to a higher contribution of wood burning versus traffic in the evening compared to the morning hours. During the night between 20:00 and 5:00 h CET, the decrease of CO, NO x and b abs values can be explained with the reduction of local emissions from traffic and wood burning, and the dilution and advection of cleaner air due to down slope and down valley winds (Pre´voˆt et al., 2000a) . In summer, much lower values and weaker diurnal cycles were observed for CO, NO x , b abs (370 nm) and b abs (880 nm) than those observed in winter. All four parameters exhibited concentration peaks around 06:00 h CET indicating the influence of the morning rush hour traffic emissions and low mixing height. The concentrations then decreased towards midday following the increase in solar radiation which enhanced vertical mixing and photochemistry. During the day mixing often occurs up to 1500-2000 m a.s.l. in summer (Henne et al., 2004) . Some air and pollution within the valley is even transported out of the valley to altitudes of 2000-4000 m a.s.l. (Pre´voˆt et al., 2000b) . In the evening hours between 18:00 and 20:00 h CET, the NO x concentrations increased slightly due to the evening rush hour traffic emissions and again lower mixing height. The lowest values of these four parameters were observed between midnight and 04:00 h CET, when the emissions were low."

From this time on the a values increased steadily until midnight with the highest median value of 1.8 (95th-percentile of 2.0) around 00:00 h CET. These values are similar to the values obtained by Kirchstetter et al. (2004) from wood smoke aerosols. In summer, no significant diurnal cycle was observed, and the a values were relatively constant throughout the day with median values between 1.0 and 1.1 (95th-percentile of 1.3). These values are comparable to the a obtained from diesel soot experiments or near roadway measurements (Schnaiter et al., 2003 (Schnaiter et al., , 2005 Kirchstetter et al., 2004) . The fact that the shapes of the volume size distributions dV/d log D do not significantly vary during the day (Fig. 1) suggests that the changes observed in a can be attributed to diurnal variations in the chemical composition of the particles rather than to variations in the particle size.

Therefore, the ratio of CO/NO x might be used as an indicator for the relative emission strength of wood burning and traffic. Fig. 7 shows that a positive correlation (r 2 ¼ 0.5) between a 370-520 nm and the ratio of CO/NO x is found for conditions influenced by fresh traffic emission (NO x 420 ppb). A similar positive correlation was observed when plotting a 370-950 nm instead of a 370-520 nm (not shown). The gray symbols in Fig. 7 refer to periods with low NO x values which resulted in higher CO/NO x ratios. In winter, low NO x concentrations were found during the night between 22:00 and 06:00 h CET due to lower emission rates and dilution with aged air having a higher CO/NO x concentration ratio because of the lower lifetime of NO x compared to CO. In summer, photochemical reactions reduced the NO x concentrations more rapidly than carbon monoxide, yielding rather high CO/NO x values during most of the day except the morning hours. In summer (red squares), we obtained a 370-520 nm values of 1.070.1 (same values for a 370-950 nm ) and a CO/NO x of 8.772.0. This ratio is comparable to the CO/NO x values between 8.8 and 9.4 ppm ppm À1 reported by Kirchstetter et al. (1999) for the Caldecott tunnel with 4% heavy-duty diesel traffic in summer 1997.

During the day between 06:00 and 12:00 h CET (green triangles) a 370-520 nm was 1.870.3 (a 370-950 nm ¼ 1.470.2) and the CO/ NO x ratio was 10.974.4 ppm ppm À1 . These CO/ NO x values observed in winter are much lower than those reported in wood combustion studies. For example, an average ratio of CO/NO x of 137 ppm ppm À1 was found for old-type residential boilers fired with dry wood logs (Johansson et al., 2004) . Another wood combustion study by Koyuncu and Pinar (2007) yielded a CO/NO x ratio of 195 ppm ppm À1 for a domestic heating stove operated with firewood. Although particulate matter was mostly dominated by wood combustion emission, we did not observe CO/NO x ratios 4100 ppm ppm À1 in winter because the traffic emissions strongly decreased the ratio due to their relatively high gaseous emissions. According to Johansson et al. (2004) and Kirchstetter et al. (1999) , the PM/CO (PM/NO x ) emission ratio of old-type wood boilers are between 3 and 20 (35-2400) times higher than for mixed traffic conditions. Only a small percentage of traffic PM emissions is thus needed to substantially reduce the CO/NO x ratio from pure wood burning conditions closer to the traffic emission ratios. For example, 90% PM from wood burning and 10% PM from traffic (see discussion of 14 C results below) would lead to a CO/NO x ratio in the range of 13-31, which is similar to the CO/NO x value of 16.776.5 ppm ppm À1 observed in the evening periods in Roveredo (Fig. 7) ."

This confirms that the seasonal and diurnal trends observed in the absorption exponent a were not caused by variations in the particle size but by the chemical composition. The wavelength dependence of the light absorption can be better approximated by separate exponential fits of the lower (370-520 nm) and the higher (660-950 nm) wavelengths (r 2 40.99 instead of r 2 p0.90 obtained by an exponential curve fit over all seven wavelengths). In winter, the a values were significantly larger and the diurnal cycle stronger for the lower wavelengths (a 370-520 nm ¼ 2.370.5) compared to the higher wavelengths (a 660-950 nm ¼ 1.470.2). In summer, the light absorption coefficients a 370-520 nm , a 370-520 nm and a 370-520 nm were within a narrow range of 0.96 and 1.13, with weak diurnal cycles. A positive correlation (r 2 ¼ 0.5) between a and the CO/NO x ratio was found for conditions influenced by fresh traffic emission (NO x 420 ppb). This confirms the influence of the relative contribution of wood burning and traffic on a. In winter, a significant influence by wood burning throughout the day was indicated by the high a values which reached maximum values at nighttime. Thus, a calculated from the light absorption coefficients in the UV-and near-IR wavelengths can be used as an indicator for wood burning activity in this region."
