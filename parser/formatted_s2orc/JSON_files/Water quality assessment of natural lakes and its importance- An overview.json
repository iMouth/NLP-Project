    "abstract": "The proportion of freshwater on earth's surface is only 2.5% of which only 1% is accessible for use. In this context, lakes are one of the most important water resources and have been used as a source of water supply for human consumption and in general accounts for about 0.3% of the total surface water body sources. As such, the conditions of lakes have been in constant deterioration due to increased anthropogenic activities surrounding them. In principle, the quality of lake water (or other surface sources) is evaluated using various physico-chemical and biological parameters selected on the Designated Best Use (DBU) of the water body (lake) for various purposes. Consequently, the use of Water Quality Index (WQI) is an important tool used for designating the quality of lake water. In general, natural lakes are confined bodies of water lacking a strong flow for self-cleansing of its water and therefore leading to accumulation of various impurities. In such cases, the quality of these impurities are determined using different indices like Heavy Metal Index (for heavy metals), eutrophication potential (due to nutrients) and other associated indices system. The determination of existing properties helps in determination of future trends of such pollutants and thereby the quality of the lake water in future scenario. Different modelling techniques are used for prediction of futuristic changes in lake water quality including watershed models, ground water models and lake models. The present study gives an overview and critically evaluates the literature on all aspects of water quality to give an insight of the various tools and techniques used for complete water quality monitoring and management.",

            "answers": [
                "The water quality considers physical, chemical and biological parameters for defining the quality of water and its maintenance. The various parameters such as TDS, pH, Temperature, BOD, COD, Phosphorous, DO, Bacteria, Phytoplankton, SO 4 , Ca, Na, Mg, NO 3 , NO 2 , NH 4 , are determined and compared with the standard limits prescribed by agencies such as CPCB, WHO, BIS etc.. The variability of these components is then compared with the present standards to determine the usage for different purposes like drinking, bathing, fisheries, agriculture etc according to the guidelines prescribed by central board. The parameters create huge data sets therefore water quality Index is a method which presents the overall quality of water. There is large number of water quality indices available around globe used for various purposes such as surface water quality, irrigation, ground water quality, heavy metal determination, overall pollution determination, trophic status determination etc. The index value gives a single value which can be compared with the range values specified for classification of water quality as High, Medium or low respectively.",
                "Therefore it can be concluded that a complete water quality criteria should not only include the basic water quality parameter determination but should involve a complete analysis of water quality comprising physical, chemical, biological and toxicological component analysis to determine all the potential uses of the water body.",
                "The water quality in the water bodies is greatly dependent on the physical, chemical and biological parameters and their interaction with each other. According to [12] the lakes are a unique system to study the interactions among various water quality parameters since they offer a unique ecosystem quite different from land or air. There are quite a large number of physical, chemical and biological parameters which needs to be evaluated before deciding the specific usage of water. According to the water quality monitoring guidelines by Central Pollution Control Board of India [21] the parameters to be decided greatly depends upon the purpose for which water to be utilized in the society. Table 2 presents the parameters and their permissible values for various DBU of the present water sources. These above parameters need to be evaluated for the determination of best use of the water available around the place. The various physico-chemical and biological parameters are in relation to each other and the overall quality of water depends upon the deviation from the permissible range."

                "With increase in the globalization the use and production of plastic has significantly increased to 300 million tonnes globally which in past 50 years, the increased use of plastic generates a lot of waste which like other classes of waste does not degrade or rot therefore leading to a global accumulation of the plastic waste. This plastic usually washes away in the lakes or oceans through streams, rivers or small rivulets and end up being a part of the water bodies, with the action of wind, sunlight or disturbances by waves these plastics breakdown into smaller particles thereby getting to a size smaller than 5 mm and microplastics or secondary plastics [115] .

                "333 mm mesh was used by [117] to take samples across Lake Laurentian and it was found to have about 43,000 microplastics/ km 2 and about 466,000 microplastics/km 2 downstream of 2 major cities. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique was used to determine microplastics and it was found that the plastics were generally in form of microbeads originating from the packaging of consumer products originating from urban effluents.",
                "In the study related to microplastic in Lake Winnipeg in Canada, [118] found that during the sampling duration of 2014 to 2016 the densities and the quantities of plastics were high as compared to Laurentian Great Lakes. The plastic was in the form of fibres known as secondary plastic. Though the effects of microplastics are unknown but it has been found to even exist around lakes with very sparse populations. The rivers are detected to be main source of carrying microplastics to the oceans and large sea. The lakes in remote areas also contain huge quantities of microplastics. The 2 lakes in Italy namely lake Bolsena and lake Chiusi were evaluated by [119] for microplastic contamination, themanta trawls approximately 6 in number were rotated around for determination of microplastic contents. The microplastics were found not only in the lake water but also in lake sediments. In lake Chiusi 2.68 to 3.36 particles/m 3 were found whereas in Lake Bolsena 0.82 to 4.42 particles/m 3 were detected. The factors such as location, type, wind intensity, waves, storm also determine the quantity of plastics in the lakes. The mean of 112 (Lake Bolsena) to 234 (Lake Chiusi) particles/kg was found. The Tibetan plateau which is known for sparse population and almost negligible human activities was also analysed by [120] for determining the microplastics in the Siling Co basin of the Plateau, the microplastics were confirmed in 6 out of 7 sites ranging from 8 ± 14 to 563 ± 1219 items/m 2 . River input is thought to be the main cause of the plastics in the lake. The nature of plastic is found to be generally packing and daily plastic products. Raman spectroscopyand SEM techniques were used for determining the texture of the microplastics. China's largest lake, Qinghai Lake was evaluated for presence of microplastics by [121] .

In the past few years strict regulations and control have increased rapidly in monitoring of surface water bodies due to deteriorating environmental concerns. The quality of the lake water is dependent on the geological structure of earth and also on the anthropogenic activities surrounding it such as construction, waste dumping, agriculture and other associated activities [2] [3] [4] [5] as these destroy the potential use of water [6] . As the water percolates through the soil it adds into itself a large amount of soluble and insoluble substances which alters the properties of the water making it less potable and in some cases unpalatable [7] [8] [9] . In essence, the variations in physico-chemical properties fluctuate on both temporal and spatial scales [10, 11] . The surface water bodies such as lakes, rivers and springs are the important sources of fresh water [12] . The insufficiency in the surface water resources makes the people dependent on the groundwater for the regular water supply. In this context, lakes are one of the most important water resources and are classified as either man made or natural and have been used as a source of water supply for human consumption [13] . The imbalance on the water inflow and outflow could lead to cultural Eutrophication in these lakes [14] . The nutrients enter into the lake water through disposal of human excreta and agricultural wastes which are rich in fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium with phosphorous being the major factor limiting the growth of algae and eutrophication in lake water [15] . With water scarcity being already an important environmental problem the present focus is on improvement in the quality of existing water sources particularly lakes by means of characterization for improving and restora-tion of the water quality [16] .The water quality is defined on the physico-chemical parametric values determined [17] . The parametric values reveal the present status of the water body and the prolonged evaluations of these parameters easily depict the hydrological modifications taking place in the water bodies [18] . Table 1 presents the permissible standards for drinking water quality as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) [19] . The water quality may be evaluated on the basis of requirements of one or more species such as flora, fauna or human beings [20] ."

The term ambiguity clearly means that the process of indexing cannot be solved in fixed number of steps and might need additional number of steps with extra interpretations. There can be an ambiguity related to measurement of parameters or due to spatial distributions in the water body which are generally not considered in case of traditional water quality index [49] . Rigidity of parameters is another problem of these indices as the additional parameters other than the existing ones; therefore the water quality index aggregation used for one area might be ambiguous for other areas [50, 51] . Rigidity is based on parameters used in indices, when area demands utilization of extra parameters for a certain water quality issue determination in concerned area but the WQI does not allow doing so then the rigidity factor comes into play. There is no scope for additional parameters to be included. Table 3 presents an insight of WQI used around the globe along with the concerned parameters measured their permissible limits and the area of application."

The plastics were polyethylene and polypropylene as determined by Raman Spectroscopy. The centre of the lake contains high amount of plastics due to tourist effects. In Indian Context [122] studied the sediments of Vembanad lake of Kochi which is a freshwater system and a Ramsar Site. Density separation was used for separation of microplastics, Micro Raman Spectroscopy was used for identification of polymers. Low density polyethylene has been detected as prevalent type of microplastic posing a threat to the fish density in the lake, since the fish is the largest source of food and bioaccumulation of microplastics can be a threat due to non-reporting of effects till date."

            "text": "The water quality considers physical, chemical and biological parameters for defining the quality of water and its maintenance. The various parameters such as TDS, pH, Temperature, BOD, COD, Phosphorous, DO, Bacteria, Phytoplankton, SO 4 , Ca, Na, Mg, NO 3 , NO 2 , NH 4 , are determined and compared with the standard limits prescribed by agencies such as CPCB, WHO, BIS etc.. The variability of these components is then compared with the present standards to determine the usage for different purposes like drinking, bathing, fisheries, agriculture etc according to the guidelines prescribed by central board. The parameters create huge data sets therefore water quality Index is a method which presents the overall quality of water. There is large number of water quality indices available around globe used for various purposes such as surface water quality, irrigation, ground water quality, heavy metal determination, overall pollution determination, trophic status determination etc. The index value gives a single value which can be compared with the range values specified for classification of water quality as High, Medium or low respectively."

            "text": "The complete water quality determination not only requires the physical, chemical and biological components but also requires assessment of toxicological components such as heavy metals and the heavy nutrients from use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers which even if exceeding the permissible limits in trace amounts can cause a great harm to not only the human beings but also aquatic animals and plants. The accumulation of these heavy metals can lead to bioaccumulation in the environment thereby entering the food chain and causing tremendous damage to health of humans, animals and plants. The nutrients produced from used of fertilizers and pesticides get washed up in the water bodies during monsoon and increase the productivity of the water bodies creating many detectable and non-detectable issue, one such issue being eutrophication which causes the excessive growth of algae and reduction in DO posing a harm to aquatic life. The study also discusses about microplastics in a small segment and their possible effects summarized in the literature."
