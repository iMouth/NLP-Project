Convection results when a difference in total gas pressure exists between two locations. Diffusion will occur even if the total pressure is uniform as long as there is a spatial difference in the chemical potential, normally represented by differences in concentration or partial pressure, of the components of a gas mixture (Kittel, 1969) . While both processes are important in soils, diffusion is considered to dominate during normal gaseous exchange (Evans, 1965) .",

                "text": "[2], the flux of a gas being equal to its gradient multiplied by a simple coefficient, is very misleading and requires closer examination. The equations for gaseous diffusion were developed by Stefan (in Wilke, 1950) and Maxwell (1952) among others. The equations are based on the statistical mechanics description of ideal gases developed by Gibbs and Boltzmann (Kittel, 1969) . These equations have been extensively developed in the literature and found to agree very closely with experiments on gas diffusion, especially at near normal temperatures and pressures (Hirschfelder et al., 1964; Fairbanks and Wilke, 1950) . Since the interest in gas diffusion in soils has increased in recent years (Smith, 1977; Bakker and Hidding, 1970; DeJong et al., 1979 , and others) and Pick's Law is used to describe the process in most soils literature (see Wood and Greenwood, 1971 , for an exception), it would seem advisable to compare Pick's Law (Eq. [2] ) to the Stefan-Maxwell diffusion equations in order to gauge its validity. This paper will examine several simple cases of diffusion of interest in soil science. It is not our intention to develop the Stefan-Maxwell equations in depth, nor to fully present the theory underlying them. For this, the reader is directed to the comprehensive works by Chapman and Cowling (1939) or Hirschfelder et al. (1964) , or to the excellent review by Marrero and Mason (1972) . We shall, for the remainder of the paper, consider only diffusion in the gas phase, ignoring gas-liquid interactions, convection, turbulence, or other mass flow phenomena, and for simplicity will consider only steady-state diffusion, although the results are directly applicable to the nonsteady-state case. Chapman and Cowling (1939, p. 244) have shown that for diffusion, the average velocity of one gas in relation to a second gas is represented by",

The first term represents ordinary or concentration diffusion, which we are concerned with in this paper. The second term represents diffusion caused by differences in total pressure, but should not be confused with mass flow. As an example of pressure diffusion, lighter elements, such as helium will concentrate in the upper portions of the atmosphere due to diffusion driven by pressure differences in the atmosphere. The gases respond to the pressure gradient created by gravity and not to gravity directly. The third term represents a diffusional flux created by an external force, such as a flow of charged particles in an electric field giving rise to an electric current. The final term represents thermal diffusion. In thermal diffusion, a temperature difference will cause diffusion within a gas mixture, with the lighter components concentrating near the warmer zone. If the temperature gradient is maintained, the gas components will continue to separate until ordinary diffusion exactly balances thermal diffusion. Of the four terms, only concentration or ordinary diffusion is important under normal circumstances in soil and plant processes, although thermal diffusion is used in commercial refining techniques for separating isotopes of some gases (Jones and Furry, 1946; Vasaru et al., 1969).",

As the flux ratio deviates further from 1.0, the O 2 diffusion coefficient diverges rapidly as F 02 increases (Fig. 2) . D F for CO 2 is less variable but can deviate markedly from its value at r CO2iO2 = 1 -0 at low values of the flux ratio and high CO 2 (low O 2 ) concentrations (Fig. 3) . Values for the flux ratio in soils have been reported ranging between 0.6 and 4.0 (Bunt and Rovira, 1955; Rixon and Bridge, 1968; Bridge and Rixon, 1976) . Although none of these authors reported the O 2 and CO 2 mole fractions at which these ratios were found, extreme values of 0.0 to 0.21 for O 2 and 0.0 and 0.09 for CO 2 have been measured (Russell and Apple yard, 1915) . Using the values of 0.05 for F CO2 and 0.15 for F 02 and a flux ratio of 2.0, we can see from Fig. 2  and 3 that deviations in the Fickian diffusion coefficients of 15% for O 2 and 9% for CO 2 from the values at r CO2j02 = 1.0 are possible. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the potential hazard of applying values of the Fickian diffusion coefficient from one situation to another where the flux ratio and gas composition may not be the same. This may be, at least in part, the reason why flux calculations based which are in the form of Pick's Law with diffusion coefficients %   3   2  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  4  2   7   3  5  3  10  3 on concentration gradients do not compare well to other techniques for measuring flux (DeJong et al., 1979) . Equation [8] also applies to diffusion in four-component or greater gas mixtures. An O 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , and Ar or O 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , Ar, and H 2 O vapor atmosphere would be mixtures of interest in soils. However, as in the ternary case, unless some simplifying assumptions can be made, the exact solution for diffusion in these mixtures is not possible.",

The temperature range over which these coefficients were fit and the uncertainty limits in D'j at the lower end of the temperature range are also given in Table 1 . An example calculation of D'j using values in Table 1 is as follows. The pressure-independent, diffusion coefficient for the gas pair O 2 -CO 2 is calculated from Eq. [30] with the coefficients from The diffusion coefficients are highly sensitive to temperature with a 30% variation possible under normal, seasonal soil temperature fluctuations. For example, the binary diffusion coefficient for the O 2 -CO 2 gas pair is equal to 0.136 X 10~4 at 0\u00b0C (273 K) and 0.165 X 10~4 at 30 \u00b0C (303 K) or D O2CO2 is 22% greater at 30 \u00b0C than 0\u00b0C. SUMMARY The comparison of the Stefan-Maxwell equations and Pick's Law for diffusion of gas through vapor shows that only under certain, special circumstances is the diffusion coefficient for Pick's Law, D Fi , a constant independent of the mole fraction of / and the diffusion flux of other gases. These special cases are the diffusion of a trace amount of component /, in a multicomponent gas mixture, equimolar, counter-current diffusion in a binary gas mixture, and equimolar, counter-current diffusion of two gases in a ternary system with the third gas stagnant. In general, D F , is dependent on the binary diffusion coefficients, the composition of the gas mixture, and the diffusional flux ratios of the gas components. Measured values of D Ft can only be accurately extrapolated to other circumstances when all the above conditions are similar. In an O 2 , CO 2 , and N 2 atmosphere where N 2 is stagnant, variations on the order of 10% from the tracer value of D F for O 2 and CO 2 are possible with variations in the mole fraction, or flux ratio. The diffusion coefficients are most sensitive to changes in the flux ratio for ratios < 0.8 or > 1.2. The temperature-and pressure-dependent nature of the diffusion coefficient must also be considered.
