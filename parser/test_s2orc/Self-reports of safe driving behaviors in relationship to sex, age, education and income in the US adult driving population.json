    "abstract": "This study analyzed the data of a health and safety survey conducted on a representative sample of the adult driving population. The analysis focused on the relationships between self-reported safe driving behaviors (including belt use, observing speed limits, and abstaining from drinking and driving), and demographic characteristics (including sex, age, education and income). The results showed that the three behaviors are quite independent of each other, and, contrary to some stereotypes, there is no single high-risk group that is most likely to violate all three safe driving behaviors. The only consistent effect was that of sex: women reported higher observance rates of all three behaviors. Reported use of safety belts increases with age and education for both men and women. However while for women the reported use increases with income, for males the reported use does not change with income. Complete avoidance of drinking and driving was reported by most drivers in all groups, and the high rates hardly varied across the different age, education, and income groups. The number of people who reported that they observe the speed limit all the time increased with age, but decreased with increasing education and income. The results have implications for identifying violation-specific high-risk groups, and stressing different factors for each.",

                "text": "Perceptions, attitudes and reported behaviors concerning health and safety of the American adult public were captured in annual surveys sponsored by Prevention Magazine between 1983 and 1995. The first 11 surveys were conducted by the Louis Harris and Associates organization, and the last two were conducted by Princeton Research Associates, Inc. The annual surveys were conducted by phone on a random sample of 1250 adults living in the US. The health-related questions dealt with habits such as smoking, exercising, drinking, dieting, weight control, stress control, dental and medical examinations, sleep, vitamin use, etc. The safety-related questions dealt with behaviors related to avoidance of home accidents, as well as driving safety questions related to speeding, drinking and driving, and use of occupant protection. This unique data source provides an opportunity to investigate national trends in driver health-related and safety-related reported behaviors and attitudes over a decade of increasing awareness of the importance of lifestyle to quality of life, and safe driving habits to traffic injury prevention. Two studies based on these data have already been published elsewhere. The first study analyzed the 11years trends (from 1985 to 1995) in drinking and driving, use of seat belts, and speeding, and compared them to the trends in health-maintenance behaviors such as smoking, drinking, avoiding cholesterol, exercising, etc. (Shinar et al., 1999) . That study demonstrated significant positive trends in avoiding drinking and driving and in the use of seatbelts, but not in most health maintenance behaviors and in observing the speed limit. The second study analyzed the relationship between drinking habits (frequency and amount), and avoiding drinking and driving, using seatbelts, and observing the speed limits (Schechtman et al., 1999) . The analysis showed that while drinking amount and frequency are related to the likelihood of drinking and driving, they are not related to risk taking behaviors such as non-use of seatbelts and speeding.",

Some support for the common perception comes from studies that have shown that speeding drivers are less likely to wear seatbelts (Preusser et al., 1988) , though an earlier observational study failed to obtain such a relationship (Wasielewski, 1984) . In a survey of 1800 Southern California drivers conducted by the Los Angeles Times in 1989 it was found that running red lights, drinking and driving (DWI), and speeding are not necessarily associated with the same sex -age -education-income characteristics. While speeding, DWI, and running red lights were more characteristic of young males, speeding (but not running red lights and DWI) was highly associated with higher education (higher than high-school) and higher income (more than $60 000) (Hemenway and Solnick, 1993) . Although Hemenway and Solnick's study was not representative of the general US population, its findings cast a doubt on the robustness of the stereotypical high-risk driver population.",

Education should provide a strong cognitive component of safety attitudes; and income as a measure of socio-economic status, should also be related to the prevailing norms among more educated people. Thus it can be expected that the three variables would have a synergistic effect on each of the three driving behaviors evaluated here.",

The samples, stratified by the variables of geographic region and metropolitan versus non-metropolitan residence, provide an accuracy of 1% on each of these variables. Within each stratum, a primary sampling unit (PSU) is defined based on a process of multistage, unclustered sampling. One interview -based on random-digit-dialing method -is conducted for each PSU. Within each household a fixed respondent selection procedure is employed to determine the person to be interviewed. The procedure provides a 'good distribution of respondents by age and sex' (Louis Harris and Assoc., 1993 -Appendix A, p. 95). For the total annual sample size of 1250 the sampling error is estimated at 2-3%. However, the error increases substantially as the sample shrinks, so that for small subsamples of 100 respondents the error may already reach 10%. For the present analysis, combining two annual samples should reduce the sampling error to less than two percent for any main effect that is tested.",

In addition, the same data set can be used to study the likelihood of observing each behavior 'all the time' gi6en driver age, sex, education, and income. To find the best explanatory variables for estimating the probability that a driver will obey the law 'all the time', a stepwise logistic regression was used for each behavior. The dependent variable was binary: 1 if the safe behavior was 'always' observed; and 0 otherwise. The independent variables were age (11 levels), sex, income (six levels), education (seven levels), and all of their twoway interactions. Results showed that for speeding, the most predictive model included age, sex and the interaction of income with education. For drinking and driving, the most predictive variables were sex, interaction of income with education, and the interaction of sex with age. For using seat belts, the most predictive variables were age, income, education, and the interaction of sex with income. However, none of the logistic models had a satisfactory predictive power, with sensitivities approaching 0 for a 0.5 decision criterion, and concordance levels ranging from 66 to 68%, for all three measures.",

Social desirability -the need to reply in a manner consistent with positive social norms -can have a large effect on people's responses. To the extent that using seatbelts, observing the speed limits, and avoiding DWI are all socially desirable behaviors, there may be a bias in the reported percentages of those who comply with these behaviors. Thus the absolute values may be suspect. On the other hand, this data base is very telling in the differences among the three behaviors and in the association between each of them and the individual characteristics measured here.",

Still, the percentages of people practicing each of these behaviors, varied widely across age, sex, education, and income levels, but not in a uniform manner. This pattern of results suggests that efforts to increase seatbelt use, reduce DWI, and reduce speeding should be directed differentially at different target groups. The idea that the high risk drivers are the same people who tend to commit all unsafe behaviors is not supported by these results. In contrast, our findings are consistent with those of Hemenway and Solnick (1993) , who reported that drivers with higher income and higher education were more likely to report that they speed than drivers with lower income and lower education.",

One possibility is that as the level of education increases, people become more familiar with conflicting arguments and data about the relationship between speed and crashes. Also, in the absence of belief about the impact of speeding on safety, the reliance on enforcement that is typically restricted to fines, is not very effective, since as the level of income increases, the deterring effect of the fine decreases. This is not the case with respect to the role of seatbelts and DWI. The primary reason people give for using seatbelts is to avoid injury (rather than habit, 'it's the law', or avoiding a ticket) (Boyle and Sharp, 1997) . Thus it seems that there is now wide agreement about their perceived effectiveness in injury reductions, so people are more likely to wear seatbelts for their perceived safety value. For DWI -a behavior that is difficult to eradicate in the case of addiction -both the tolerance of the police is low and the penalties meted out by the courts are much more severe than just fines.",

Most health-related and safety-related questions have a definite 'socially desirable' answer; and all other things being equal, people are generally biased to respond in socially desirable fashion (e.g. 'I always use safety belts'), than a socially undesirable fashion (e.g. 'I never use safety belts'). Consequently, in evaluating the data from such questions, one should assume that the true levels of compliance with any behavior are probably lower than the levels reported in this survey. The implication of this bias is that trends and relationships obtained in this study are much more valid than the absolute levels reported. The actual absolute levels of reported compliance with any behavior can be used as valid indicators only when the relationship between the true behavior and the self-reported one has been previously established. For example, in the case of safety belts, Streff and Waggenaar (1989) estimate that the reported safety belt use rate is 1.3 times higher than the actual use rate. However, even then there may be other moderating variables that make such a simplification tenuous. In the specific case of safety belts, the adjustment that is needed appears to vary among different age groups (Shinar, 1993) .",
