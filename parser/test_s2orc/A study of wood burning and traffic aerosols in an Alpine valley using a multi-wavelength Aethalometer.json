    "abstract": "We present a study of aerosol light absorption using a multi-wavelength Aethalometer (l \u00bc 370-950 nm) in an Alpine valley where the major local emissions of aerosols in winter are from domestic wood burning and traffic. The measurements were done in winter and summer periods in 2004 and 2005. Much stronger diurnal trends in CO, NO x and aerosol light absorption parameters were observed in winter than in summer. The average (71 S.D.) PM 10 concentrations measured at this site were 31.5721.7 mg m \u00c03 in winter and 15.8710.0 mg m \u00c03 in summer. The highest PM 10 concentrations were observed between 18:00 and 22:00 h CET in both campaigns, with 45.4721.0 mg m \u00c03 for winter and 21.079.5 mg m \u00c03 for summer. The average (71 S.D.) power law exponents of the absorption coefficients (also called absorption exponent) with l \u00bc 370-950 nm, a 370-950 nm were 1.670.25 in winter and 1.170.05 in summer. The calculation of a separately for lower and higher wavelengths (i.e., a 370-520 nm and a 660-950 nm) provided a better description of the wavelength dependence from the UV-to the near-IR region. The highest mean values of a 370-520 nm and a 660-950 nm were observed between 22:00 and 02:00 h CET in winter with 2.770.4 and 1.370.1, respectively. Comparison of a 370-520 nm with CO and NO x data indicated that the relative contribution of wood burning versus traffic was responsible for the seasonal and diurnal variability of a. The seasonal and diurnal trends of a were not attributed to changes in the particle size since the aerosol volume size distributions (dV/d log D) were found to be similar in both campaigns.",

For example, sulfate aerosols scatter sunlight and therefore have a cooling effect, while black carbon (BC) aerosols absorb sunlight resulting in a warming effect (Andreae, 2001) . Furthermore, aerosols have an indirect effect by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) which leads to a distribution of the cloud's liquid water over more and smaller droplets. As a result, the optical properties and lifetime of clouds in the atmosphere change. Both the direct and indirect effects of the anthropogenic aerosols together produce a cooling effect on the radiative balance (IPCC, 2007) .",

Especially the fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter o2.5 mm (PM 2.5 ) is of great concern because it can easily enter the human respiratory system. Many studies have provided evidence that ambient PM 2.5 concentration strongly correlates with mortality rate (e.g., Dockery et al., 1993; Laden et al., 2006) , and that long-term exposure of combustion-related fine particulates increases the risk for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality (Pope et al., 2002) .",

Wood combustion performed at poor operating conditions, e.g., low temperatures such as in old stoves, leads to higher emissions of CO and particulate matter compared to combustion in automatic or certified furnaces (Johansson et al., 2004) . The combustion of fossil fuel in motor vehicles occurs at high temperatures, which generally leads to high NO x emissions, and thus distinctly lower CO/NO x emission ratios in comparison to wood burning.",

We investigated the variability and diurnal cycles of the aerosol light absorption in relation to concurrently measured other aerosol variables, trace gases and meteorological parameters. We provide evidence that variations of the wood burning and traffic emission source strengths lead to a systematic diurnal cycle of the aerosol light absorption parameters at 370 and 880 nm. In addition, we provide a modified power law approximation of the wavelength dependence of the aerosol light absorption.",

The village is located in the Mesolcina valley south of the main Alpine crest (46114 0 18 00 N, 9107 0 45 00 E, 298 m above sea level (m a.s.l.)). A two-lane highway connecting the San Bernardino Pass and the Gotthard highway passes through the village. A 3-m high concrete wall separates the highway from the measurement container and residential area. In the winter period between December and February, the village lies most of the time in the shadow of the surrounding steep hills and mountains, providing favorable condition for persistent and strong temperature inversions. Approximately 77% of the houses in this village use wood burning for heating in winter, with similar numbers in neighboring villages (H.P. Lo\u00a8tscher, personal communication). The annual mean PM 10 concentration measured in this location has been rather constant at 25 mg m \u00c03 during the last 8 years (ANU Graubu\u00a8nden, www.gr-luft.ch). The winter and summer campaigns took place between 13 December 2004 and 24 January 2005, and between 1 and 20 June 2005, respectively.",

The sheath and aerosol flow rates were set to 3.0 and 0.3 l min \u00c01 (lpm), respectively, which allowed for measurements of particles with mobility diameters between 14 and 820 nm. The SMPS size distributions were corrected for multiply charged particles. The aerosol light absorption was measured with a seven wavelength Aethalometer (Magee Scientific, l \u00bc 370, 470, 520, 590, 660, 880 and 950 nm) . This instrument collected the aerosol on quartz fiber filter spots at a flow of 2.570.1 lpm in winter and 2.870.2 lpm in summer. The data were recorded every 2 min. The minimum detection limit for BC is 0.2 mg m \u00c03 at this time resolution (note that averaging the data into 30-min resolution lowers the detection limit to 15 ng m \u00c03 ). Both the SMPS and the Aethalometer were connected to a whole air inlet without size-cut at ambient relative humidity conditions which enters the temperaturecontrolled measurement container. The air flow rates were calibrated with a Gilibrator bubble flow meter.",

For the remaining of this paper, we will refer to this as the absorption exponent a. This empirical power law fit provides a ''standardized'' approach for comparison with data sets from other studies. For example, a values (using the light absorption of all wavelengths l \u00bc 370, 470, 520, 590, 660, 880 and 950 nm) up to 1.5 were observed at a high Alpine station during a Saharan dust event (Collaud Coen et al., 2004) . Fialho et al. (2006) calculated a during a Sahara dust event in the Azores archipelago to be 1.070.2 using only the visible wavelengths (l \u00bc 470, 520, 590, 660 nm). However, in polluted areas where high soot concentrations are observed-like the village in our study-the absorption of dust is usually negligible. Kirchstetter et al. (2004) reported a values of 2.2 for an outdoor firewood burning, 1.8 for a savanna fire and 0.8-1.1 for traffic-dominated sites (measurements with six wavelengths between 370 and 850 nm). Schnaiter et al. ( , 2005 reported a values of 1.1 for uncoated diesel soot and 2.1 for spark generated (Palas) soot (measurements with l \u00bc 450, 550 and 700 nm). The type of wood being burned also influences the a value as shown by Day et al. (2006) where they measured fresh wood smoke from seven types of forest wood with an Aethalometer (using the same l's as in this study) and reported a values between 0.9 and 2.2. Hoffer et al. (2006) calculated a \u00bc 6-7 for water-soluble HULIS isolated from the fine fraction of biomass burning aerosols (spectrophotometer measurements with l \u00bc 300-700 nm).",

Fig. 1 shows median size distributions of dN/d log D and dV/d log D for the two time periods 06:00-08:00 and 17:00-21:00 h CET in both campaigns. The analysis shows that the particles with diameters between 20 and 30 nm dominated the particle number concentration in winter during the morning traffic rush hours, while in the evening the particle number concentrations were highest in the size range between 70 and 100 nm. In the calculated particle volume size distributions (dV/d log D) the particles with diameters between 200 and 300 nm contributed most to the aerosol sub-micron mass both in the morning and evening hours. This confirms that traffic and wood combustion result in similar volume size distributions, as also reported by Schneider et al. (2005) and Hedberg et al. (2002) . Additionally, the geometric mean diameters (GMD) of the computed particle surface size distributions dS/d log D were calculated as 154.2 nm with a geometric mean standard deviation (GMS) of 2.2 for 06:00-08:00 h CET, and GMD \u00bc 157.4 nm and GMS \u00bc 2.1 for 17:00-21:00 h CET.",

The diurnal cycles of NO x and b abs (880 nm) in winter exhibited two peaks at 10:00 and 20:00 h CET. In contrast, CO and b abs (370 nm) did not peak in the morning but had only a maximum at 20:00 h CET. As will be discussed later, this is due to a higher contribution of wood burning versus traffic in the evening compared to the morning hours. During the night between 20:00 and 5:00 h CET, the decrease of CO, NO x and b abs values can be explained with the reduction of local emissions from traffic and wood burning, and the dilution and advection of cleaner air due to down slope and down valley winds (Pre\u00b4vo\u02c6t et al., 2000a) . In summer, much lower values and weaker diurnal cycles were observed for CO, NO x , b abs (370 nm) and b abs (880 nm) than those observed in winter. All four parameters exhibited concentration peaks around 06:00 h CET indicating the influence of the morning rush hour traffic emissions and low mixing height. The concentrations then decreased towards midday following the increase in solar radiation which enhanced vertical mixing and photochemistry. During the day mixing often occurs up to 1500-2000 m a.s.l. in summer (Henne et al., 2004) . Some air and pollution within the valley is even transported out of the valley to altitudes of 2000-4000 m a.s.l. (Pre\u00b4vo\u02c6t et al., 2000b) . In the evening hours between 18:00 and 20:00 h CET, the NO x concentrations increased slightly due to the evening rush hour traffic emissions and again lower mixing height. The lowest values of these four parameters were observed between midnight and 04:00 h CET, when the emissions were low.",

From this time on the a values increased steadily until midnight with the highest median value of 1.8 (95th-percentile of 2.0) around 00:00 h CET. These values are similar to the values obtained by Kirchstetter et al. (2004) from wood smoke aerosols. In summer, no significant diurnal cycle was observed, and the a values were relatively constant throughout the day with median values between 1.0 and 1.1 (95th-percentile of 1.3). These values are comparable to the a obtained from diesel soot experiments or near roadway measurements (Schnaiter et al., 2003 (Schnaiter et al., , 2005 Kirchstetter et al., 2004) . The fact that the shapes of the volume size distributions dV/d log D do not significantly vary during the day (Fig. 1) suggests that the changes observed in a can be attributed to diurnal variations in the chemical composition of the particles rather than to variations in the particle size. This is confirmed by the very similar GMD calculated from dS/d log D for the morning (154.2 nm) and evening periods (157.4 nm).",

Thus, we defined two wavelength ranges, i.e., 370-520 and 660-950 nm, and calculated a for each wavelength range.

Therefore, the ratio of CO/NO x might be used as an indicator for the relative emission strength of wood burning and traffic. Fig. 7 shows that a positive correlation (r 2 \u00bc 0.5) between a 370-520 nm and the ratio of CO/NO x is found for conditions influenced by fresh traffic emission (NO x 420 ppb). A similar positive correlation was observed when plotting a 370-950 nm instead of a 370-520 nm (not shown). The gray symbols in Fig. 7 refer to periods with low NO x values which resulted in higher CO/NO x ratios. In winter, low NO x concentrations were found during the night between 22:00 and 06:00 h CET due to lower emission rates and dilution with aged air having a higher CO/NO x concentration ratio because of the lower lifetime of NO x compared to CO. In summer, photochemical reactions reduced the NO x concentrations more rapidly than carbon monoxide, yielding rather high CO/NO x values during most of the day except the morning hours. In summer (red squares), we obtained a 370-520 nm values of 1.070.1 (same values for a 370-950 nm ) and a CO/NO x of 8.772.0. This ratio is comparable to the CO/NO x values between 8.8 and 9.4 ppm ppm \u00c01 reported by Kirchstetter et al. (1999) for the Caldecott tunnel with 4% heavy-duty diesel traffic in summer 1997. Janha\u00a8ll et al. (2006) found a CO/ NO x ratio of 5.072.6 ppm ppm \u00c01 in an urban aerosol study during winter time in Sweden.",

During the day between 06:00 and 12:00 h CET (green triangles) a 370-520 nm was 1.870.3 (a 370-950 nm \u00bc 1.470.2) and the CO/ NO x ratio was 10.974.4 ppm ppm \u00c01 . These CO/ NO x values observed in winter are much lower than those reported in wood combustion studies. For example, an average ratio of CO/NO x of 137 ppm ppm \u00c01 was found for old-type residential boilers fired with dry wood logs (Johansson et al., 2004) . Another wood combustion study by Koyuncu and Pinar (2007) yielded a CO/NO x ratio of 195 ppm ppm \u00c01 for a domestic heating stove operated with firewood. Although particulate matter was mostly dominated by wood combustion emission, we did not observe CO/NO x ratios 4100 ppm ppm \u00c01 in winter because the traffic emissions strongly decreased the ratio due to their relatively high gaseous emissions. According to Johansson et al. (2004) and Kirchstetter et al. (1999) , the PM/CO (PM/NO x ) emission ratio of old-type wood boilers are between 3 and 20 (35-2400) times higher than for mixed traffic conditions. Only a small percentage of traffic PM emissions is thus needed to substantially reduce the CO/NO x ratio from pure wood burning conditions closer to the traffic emission ratios. For example, 90% PM from wood burning and 10% PM from traffic (see discussion of 14 C results below) would lead to a CO/NO x ratio in the range of 13-31, which is similar to the CO/NO x value of 16.776.5 ppm ppm \u00c01 observed in the evening periods in Roveredo (Fig. 7) .",

This indicates a substantial wood smoke contribution even during the daytime, which is confirmed by the 14 C analysis of aerosols collected with a HIVOL sampler during this winter campaign performed by Szidat et al. (2007) , where the total organic matter (TOM) consisted of 77% non-fossil organic matter for the daytime filters (sampled between 06:00 and 14:00 h CET) and 90% for the night time filters (sampled between 18:00 and 02:00 h CET). The fossil elemental carbon material (ECM) contribution to the TOM was $8% in the morning and $4.5% in the evening filters. This provided evidence that indeed the contribution to the aerosol load from wood combustion was higher in the evening. These findings were also confirmed by aerosol mass spectrometer measurements at the same location in winter a year later (Alfarra et al., 2007) .",

In winter, approximately 77% of the houses in this village use wood burning for heating. Strong temperature inversion, low wind speed, and low solar radiation throughout the day enhanced the accumulation of aerosol particles in the air during the cold season. Very strong diurnal trends in CO, NO x and aerosol light absorption parameters were observed in winter. The absorption exponents a were between 1.2 and 2.0 (5th-and 95th-percentiles) during the winter campaign. The highest values were comparable to literature studies on wood smoke, i.e., $2. The a values from the summer campaign closely matched the literature values for diesel soot or traffic aerosol, i.e., $1.0-1.1. The GMD of the surface size distribution was 154.

This confirms that the seasonal and diurnal trends observed in the absorption exponent a were not caused by variations in the particle size but by the chemical composition. The wavelength dependence of the light absorption can be better approximated by separate exponential fits of the lower (370-520 nm) and the higher (660-950 nm) wavelengths (r 2 40.99 instead of r 2 p0.90 obtained by an exponential curve fit over all seven wavelengths). In winter, the a values were significantly larger and the diurnal cycle stronger for the lower wavelengths (a 370-520 nm \u00bc 2.370.5) compared to the higher wavelengths (a 660-950 nm \u00bc 1.470.2). In summer, the light absorption coefficients a 370-520 nm , a 370-520 nm and a 370-520 nm were within a narrow range of 0.96 and 1.13, with weak diurnal cycles. A positive correlation (r 2 \u00bc 0.5) between a and the CO/NO x ratio was found for conditions influenced by fresh traffic emission (NO x 420 ppb). This confirms the influence of the relative contribution of wood burning and traffic on a. In winter, a significant influence by wood burning throughout the day was indicated by the high a values which reached maximum values at nighttime. Thus, a calculated from the light absorption coefficients in the UV-and near-IR wavelengths can be used as an indicator for wood burning activity in this region.",
