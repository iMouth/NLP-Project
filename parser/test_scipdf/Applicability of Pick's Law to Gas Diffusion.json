            "text": "T HE EXCHANGE OF GASES between the soil and the atmosphere is of primary concern to soil scientists. Gas movement in the soil can be caused by both convection and diffusion. Convection results when a difference in total gas pressure exists between two locations. Diffusion will occur even if the total pressure is uniform as long as there is a spatial difference in the chemical potential, normally represented by differences in concentration or partial pressure, of the components of a gas mixture (Kittel, 1969). While both processes are important in soils, diffusion is considered to dominate during normal gaseous exchange (Evans, 1965).\nThe fundamental equation used to describe one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion in soil is Pick's First Law:\nq,= -aDfdCi/dz , [1] where q t is the mass transfer rate of component / per unit area (ML~2T~l), D Fi is the Fickian diffusion coefficient for component i (Z, 2^\"1 ). Q is tne concentration of i (ML~3), z is distance, and a is a correction term that modifies D Fi to account for the air-filled porosity and the tortuosity of the diffusion path in soils (Troeh et al., 1982).\nAlthough the magnitude of a is often crucial in the study of diffusional processes in soils, in the remainder of this paper the magnitude of a is inconsequential as long as its magnitude is independent of gas type (Penman, 1940b). We will therefore set a equal to 1.0 and drop it from the remaining equations. Alternatively, Eq.\n[1] can be written in terms of mole fractions by invoking the equation of state for ideal gases and Dalton's Law to give N^-D^P/RT^dYjdz, [2] where now N t is the molar flux, P is the total gas pressure, R the universal gas constant, T absolute temperature, and Y t the mole fraction of component /. While useful in soil science, it must be remembered that Pick's Law when applied to gases is strictly an empirical relation, borrowed from studies with solutes and shown to agree well with observed diffusional processes in air (Kirkham and Powers, 1972, p. 429;Penman, 1940a and1940b). The form of Eq.\n[2], the flux of a gas being equal to its gradient multiplied by a simple coefficient, is very misleading and requires closer examination. The equations for gaseous diffusion were developed by Stefan (in Wilke, 1950) and Maxwell (1952) among others. The equations are based on the statistical mechanics description of ideal gases developed by Gibbs and Boltzmann (Kittel, 1969). These equations have been extensively developed in the literature and found to agree very closely with experiments on gas diffusion, especially at near normal temperatures and pressures (Hirschfelder et al., 1964;Fairbanks and Wilke, 1950). Since the interest in gas diffusion in soils has increased in recent years (Smith, 1977;Bakker and Hidding, 1970;DeJong et al., 1979, and others) and Pick's Law is used to describe the process in most soils literature (see Wood and Greenwood, 1971, for an exception), it would seem advisable to compare Pick's Law (Eq. [2]) to the Stefan-Maxwell diffusion equations in order to gauge its validity. This paper will examine several simple cases of diffusion of interest in soil science. It is not our intention to develop the Stefan-Maxwell equations in depth, nor to fully present the theory underlying them. For this, the reader is directed to the comprehensive works by Chapman andCowling (1939) or Hirschfelder et al. (1964), or to the excellent review by Marrero and Mason (1972). We shall, for the remainder of the paper, consider only diffusion in the gas phase, ignoring gas-liquid interactions, convection, turbulence, or other mass flow phenomena, and for simplicity will consider only steady-state diffusion, although the results are directly applicable to the nonsteady-state case. Chapman and Cowling (1939, p. 244) have shown that for diffusion, the average velocity of one gas in relation to a second gas is represented by",

For our purposes, it is only important to note that the difference in average velocities of two gases (v,--v/) depends on four separate terms on the right side of Eq.\n[3], which may be thought of as the chemical potential for the gas pair (Kittel, 1969, p. 215). The first term represents ordinary or concentration diffusion, which we are concerned with in this paper. The second term represents diffusion caused by differences in total pressure, but should not be confused with mass flow. As an example of pressure diffusion, lighter elements, such as helium will concentrate in the upper portions of the atmosphere due to diffusion driven by pressure differences in the atmosphere. The gases respond to the pressure gradient created by gravity and not to gravity directly. The third term represents a diffusional flux created by an external force, such as a flow of charged particles in an electric field giving rise to an electric current. The final term represents thermal diffusion. In thermal diffusion, a temperature difference will cause diffusion within a gas mixture, with the lighter components concentrating near the warmer zone. If the temperature gradient is maintained, the gas components will continue to separate until ordinary diffusion exactly balances thermal diffusion. Of the four terms, only concentration or ordinary diffusion is important under normal circumstances in soil and plant processes, although thermal diffusion is used in commercial refining techniques for separating isotopes of some gases (Jones and Furry, 1946; Vasaru et al., 1969).\nFor ordinary diffusion in one dimension of one gas, /, through another gas, j, where total pressure and temperature are constant, Eq. \nV../I..B, -vjnjn, _ d(n,/n T ) n T D Si \" T dz [5]\nDividing both sides of Eq.\n[5] by Avagadro's number, M 0 , we convert the number densities to molar densities.\nRemembering that TV,-= v, n t /M 0 , Eq.

[8] is not identical to the binary D t j in Eq. [7], since its magnitude is affected by the entire gas mixture and not just i and j. However, this difference is slight (within the experimental error of measurement) and can be ignored (Marrero and Mason, 1972).\nIn general, Eq.\n[8] represents n-l independent equations for n unknowns since and as such the solution is indeterminate. However, under certain simplifying assumptions solutions can be found for the series of equations. We'll examine several of these situations applicable to soil and plant science.",

Equation [7]can be rearranged into a form similar to Pick's Law (Eq.\n[2]). By letting r jt equal the negative value of the ratio of the fluxes, r^ = -Nj/N h and substituting 1-F, for Yj, we can rearrange Eq.\n[7] to obtain N, [9] \\-(\\-rjl )Y, RT Comparing Eq.\n[9] and Eq.\n[2] we find by analogy that The Fickian diffusion coefficient depends not only on Dy but also on the flux ratio and mole ratio of component /. Two special circumstances immediately follow from Eq. [10].\nTracer Diffusion--In cases where Y ( is present only in trace amounts (i.e., Y, =* 0.0), Eq.\n[10] for the Fickian diffusion coefficient reduces to independent of flux ratios and concentration.\nClosed System-A second possibility for binary gas diffusion is diffusion in a closed system where, since the total pressure remains constant, N t = -TV,, r jt = 1.0 and, from Eq. [10], D Fi again just equals Dy.\nOpen System-A more general situation is the steadystate diffusion of gases through an inert layer where the concentrations of the gases are held constant at one end because of an infinite source/sink for the gases (the atmosphere) and the concentrations are fixed at the other end by consumption or production processes. An example would be oxygen diffusing into a soil ped and oxidizing ferrous to ferric iron where oxygen and nitrogen comprise the ped atmosphere. For an open system Eq.\n[9] and Eq.\n[10] cannot be solved without a priori knowledge of r^. Figure 1 illustrates the variation of D Fl with changes in ru and Y t as calculated by Eq. [10]. The reduced Fickian diffusion coefficient, D Fl /Dy, is plotted for several values of rj, over the range 0.0 < Y t < 1.0. As discussed for equimolar, counter-current diffusion in a closed system and for tracer diffusion, D Fl /D t , is constant for all values of YI when r,, = 1.0 and for all values of r,, when K/ =s 0.0. The reduced Fickian diffusion coefficient diverges rapidly, however, as Y t increases, decreasing as r jt becomes less (reduced resistance to diffusion) and increasing as r/i increases. In the extreme it can be seen from Eq.\n[10] that D Fi /Dy can become negative when the two gases are diffusing in the same direction (r,, < 0.0), that is, gas i would diffuse against its gradient. This behavior has been measured by Duncan and Toor (1962) in a three-component gas mixture.",

These equations can be used to describe diffusion in soils where the source and sink terms for O 2 (/) and CO 2 (/') are determined by plant root or soil organism respiration and the respiration quotient, CO 2 produced/O 2 consumed, is near 1.0 (e.g., r fl = 1.0). However, it must be remembered that this is only a good approximation for respiration in soils during quasisteadystate conditions because if F,-or Yj is changing rapidly, TV* = 0.0 and the simplification is not justified.\nIn Values for the binary diffusion coefficients can be calculated from Table 1 (next section). For a temperature of 20 ° C and a pressure of 1 0 1 kPa these values are 0.159 X 10-4 , 0.202 X 10-4 , and 0.159 X 1Q-4 (m 2 /s) for A) 2 ,c92> A>2,N2. and A:o 2 ,N2> respectively. The Fickian diffusion coefficients can then be calculated if values for YQ-I, F C02 , F N2 , and r CO2O2 are known. For example, with F 02 = 0.15, F C02 = 0.06, F N2 = 0.79, and r CO2O 2 = 0.5, D F02 and D FC02 are calculated to be 0.210 X 10~4 and 0.150 X 10~4 m 2 /s, respectively. These two points are indicated on Fig. 2 and 3 where the values of D F02 and D FC02 are plotted for various flux ratios. In both figures F N2 is held constant at 0.790 while F O2 varies from 0.0 to 0.21. Carbon dioxide comprises the remainder of the atmosphere (0.21 < F CO 2 ^ 0-0).\nThe apparent diffusion coefficients for both O 2 and CO 2 vary little for ^02,02 near l'-0. As the flux ratio deviates further from 1.0, the O 2 diffusion coefficient diverges rapidly as F 02 increases (Fig. 2). D F for CO 2 is less variable but can deviate markedly from its value at r CO2iO2 = 1 -0 at low values of the flux ratio and high CO 2 (low O 2 ) concentrations (Fig. 3). Values for the flux ratio in soils have been reported ranging between 0.6 and 4.0 (Bunt and Rovira, 1955;Rixon and Bridge, 1968;Bridge and Rixon, 1976). Although none of these authors reported the O 2 and CO 2 mole fractions at which these ratios were found, extreme values of 0.0 to 0.21 for O 2 and 0.0 and 0.09 for CO 2 have been measured (Russell and Apple yard, 1915). Using the values of 0.05 for F CO2 and 0.15 for F 02 and a flux ratio of 2.0, we can see from Fig. 2  and 3 that deviations in the Fickian diffusion coefficients of 15% for O 2 and 9% for CO 2 from the values at r CO2j02 = 1.0 are possible. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the potential hazard of applying values of the Fickian diffusion coefficient from one situation to another where the flux ratio and gas composition may not be the same.

Equation [8] also applies to diffusion in four-component or greater gas mixtures. An O 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , and Ar or O 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , Ar, and H 2 O vapor atmosphere would be mixtures of interest in soils. However, as in the ternary case, unless some simplifying assumptions can be made, the exact solution for diffusion in these mixtures is not possible.",

The solution involves successive approximations to D'j. The approximations converge rapidly, so that the first approximation, which is temperature-dependent but independent of gas composition and at most the second approximation, which introduces slight compositional variation, is sufficient for calculating D\\, to within at most several percent error (Marrero and Mason, 1972).\nValues for D'j (more commonly /),-,), can be found in numerous papers in the literature (see Marrero and Mason, 1972), with some recent values for carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ethylene, and ethane presented by Pritchard and Currie (1982). Marrero and Mason (1972) have compiled an extensive tabulation of binary diffusion coefficients taken from the literature. Based on the Chapman-Enskog equations and extensive experimental results, they have compiled semiempirical relations for the first approximation of over 70 gas pairs. Diffusion coefficients for gas pairs of interest in soil research are tabulated in Table 1. In all cases shown, the second approximation to Dy, which is based on the compositional ratio of component z to component j, represents a correction to the first approximation of < 1.0% at normal temperatures for the entire compositional range. This correction is within the experimental error of the measured values and can be neglected for all the gas pairs listed. The equation used by Marrero and Mason (1972) to calculate D'j is ln(a) + b\\n(T) -c/T.\n[30] Fig. 3-Fickian diffusion coefficient, D F , (m 2 s\" 1 )  They computed the constants a, b, and c by matching Eq.\n[30], whose form is suggested by the theoretical work of Chapman-Enskog, to a compilation of experimental data for each gas pair. The temperature range over which these coefficients were fit and the uncertainty limits in D'j at the lower end of the temperature range are also given in Table 1. An example calculation of D'j using values in Table 1 is as follows. The pressure-independent, diffusion coefficient for the gas pair O 2 -CO 2 is calculated from Eq. [30] with the coefficients from The diffusion coefficients are highly sensitive to temperature with a 30% variation possible under normal, seasonal soil temperature fluctuations. For example, the binary diffusion coefficient for the O 2 -CO 2 gas pair is equal to 0.136 X 10~4 at 0°C (273 K) and 0.165 X 10~4 at 30 °C (303 K) or D O2CO2 is 22% greater at 30 °C than 0°C. SUMMARY The comparison of the Stefan-Maxwell equations and Pick's Law for diffusion of gas through vapor shows that only under certain, special circumstances is the diffusion coefficient for Pick's Law, D Fi , a constant independent of the mole fraction of / and the diffusion flux of other gases. These special cases are the diffusion of a trace amount of component /, in a multicomponent gas mixture, equimolar, counter-current diffusion in a binary gas mixture, and equimolar, counter-current diffusion of two gases in a ternary system with the third gas stagnant. In general, D F , is dependent on the binary diffusion coefficients, the composition of the gas mixture, and the diffusional flux ratios of the gas components. Measured values of D Ft can only be accurately extrapolated to other circumstances when all the above conditions are similar. In an O 2 , CO 2 , and N 2 atmosphere where N 2 is stagnant, variations on the order of 10% from the tracer value of D F for O 2 and CO 2 are possible with variations in the mole fraction, or flux ratio. The diffusion coefficients are most sensitive to changes in the flux ratio for ratios < 0.8 or > 1.2. The temperature-and pressure-dependent nature of the diffusion coefficient must also be considered.
